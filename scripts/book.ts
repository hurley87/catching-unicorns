    text: `Over the last five millennia, we first invented and then refined a technology—writing—to record and share our ideas on a visible medium. I believe it’s made all the difference and I hope to convince you of that in this book.
        We sometimes think of writing as the representation of speech. But it’s more than that. For example, we now use writing to generate the staff notation of modern music, the symbols of mathematics, and the language of computer coding. I’ll refer to the complete set of these inscribed symbols and representations as exographics. I’ll refer to the act of inscribing them on the medium as exographing. “Exographing” means “writing” but includes more than just the representation of speech.
        So why is exographing important? We’ve known for some time that it plays an important role in our ability to discover certain kinds of ideas. While we’ve needed it to discover the Theory of Relativity, develop smartphones, and design computer chips, we certainly didn’t need it to innovate clothing, the back-beat, and the Nike advertising slogan “Just do it.” Consequently, my purpose is to identify precisely how exographing helps us to discover certain kinds of ideas and then explore the nature of the resulting set of ideas. We’re going to see that this set is extraordinarily large, that it’s growing at an exponential rate, and that it gives rise to our advanced techno-literate societies. I’ll claim and then justify that without exographing, we’d be living as modern oral societies do, and that is a much simpler existence lacking many of the material artifacts we currently enjoy.
        If you google “writing is thinking,” you’ll get 5.1 billion hits. At many of these sites, the eminent historian David McCullough’s meme is cited: “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly.” Here is the view of the eminent French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss:
        Writing is a strange thing. It would seem as if its appearance could not have failed to wreak profound changes in the living conditions of our race, and that the transformations must have been above all intellectual in character. Yet nothing

        of what we know of writing, or of its role in evolution, can be said to justify the
        conception.1
        Effectively he is suggesting that writing has made a difference but that nobody had yet offered a reasonable explanation why. In this book, I intend to explain why.
        I think it’s fair to say that most of us understand there is a relationship between writing and thinking, that writing helps us to think. But if I asked you how writing helps, you probably wouldn’t be able to say much. In fact, you might even argue that you don’t care how it works. You just know that it works. To be frank, that’s what my response would have been fifteen years ago. But as a result of a fortuitous observation, I got interested in the topic. As I hope to show, there is a lot we can say.
        1.1 Literacy in the Wild
        This book is going to focus on our use of literacy to think. But there are many more uses of literacy in our everyday life. Since we’re so enmeshed in it, it’s difficult to appreciate just how much we depend on it. In the face of this gap, I thought I’d track my use of it for a few hours of a pretty standard morning. My description of these hours follows and, in it, I’ve embed- ded some numbers. For each number, I’ll give a more complete explanation of the particular literacy the number refers to after the description.
        Today I woke up and wondered if it was time to get up so I checked my Fitbit which gives a digital time. It read 5:45 so I got up and did a few chores including taking my blood pressure (1). The reading from my machine is the standard two numbers, in my case 135 and 81, in addition to a graphic which tells me whether the reading is good (green), not great (yellow), or bad (red) (2). I then settled into my easy chair to look at my overnight email. One email required a slight redraft of a paper and then sending it back to my co-author (3). Then I went to the NY Times website and read for about an hour (4).
        After I finished reading, I decided to work on editing a manuscript (this one) and spent about an hour rewriting part of a chapter (5). When the time on my computer got to 8:15, I wrapped up my editing and began to get ready to go to a medical appointment at the hospital (6). The appointment was for 9 am. So I got ready, hopped in my vehicle, and headed to the hospital. Once near the hospital, I decided to park on one of the main streets. I found a spot, pulled in, and then went to the machine to get a parking ticket. I looked at the directions on this machine (I don’t use them often) to see what to do (7). When I tried to insert my coin, the machine was jammed. So I went back to my vehicle, took a blank piece
        1 Claude Lévi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques (New York: Atheneum, 1961), 291.
        
        of paper from my small notepad and left a note for parking enforcement on my dashboard. I put the date and time on the note and explained that the coin slot was jammed (8).
        Once inside the hospital, I pulled out the note I had made on how to get where I was to go: “Go to the 3rd floor, make a right, and go to Home Cardiographics.” (9) I went to the elevators and once inside one of them, I hit the button for the third floor (10). Once at the third floor, I made the right turn and walked down the hallway checking all of the signs as I ran into them. There were some overhead signs but most were on the doors. I had to check a number of these before I finally found my destination (11). Upon arrival, an attendant asked to see my medical card. Then she got out a form to do the COVID screening with me. She had clearly done this a lot so didn’t need many reminders from the form which listed the questions. But she did need a few (12). I was then instructed to go to the waiting room until they were ready to take me. Another attendant came to get me and took me to the room where someone was going to install the heart monitor I was to wear. She pulled out a sheaf of forms and began by asking me my birthdate. When I responded correctly, she proceeded to install a heart monitor on me explaining how I would do it over the two weeks. I was required to wear it 24/7 taking it off only to bathe. She also gave me written instructions and a graphic for the correct placement of the black, brown, and grey electrodes. The whole procedure took about five minutes and I then departed (13). When I got to the door, I had forgotten which way to turn. She saw me pause and then said immediately “Right and go the end of the hall.” (14) When I got in the hallway, I looked in the direction she told me and saw the standard red “Elevator” sign at the end of the hall close to the ceiling. I knew the elevators would be close at that point (15).
        Explanations
        1. Life Management: I have to be literate to read my Fitbit and being able to tell the time enables me to organize my day.
        2. Life Management: With Fitbits, blood pressure measurement devices, and other self- measurement tools, we’re better able to manage our individual health. But to do this, we have to be literate. I have to be able to read and understand the digital and graphi- cal measurements these devices produce.
        3. Ideation and Recording: I’d been engaging with a colleague on a paper and he had suggested an edit, one that I would have to word. I thought his suggestion was good so massaged the paper until I was happy with it. It took me about three tries until I thought my words captured what my colleague suggested. Getting the words cor- rectly on paper for me is a matter of drafting and redrafting until I think I’ve captured the idea. What is clear is that I’m thinking and hence this is the ideation purpose
        Chapter 1 Preliminaries 5

        6
        Chapter 1 Preliminaries
        of writing. Additionally, there is a recording purpose. Once I have the right words, they’re in a file and captured. When I was happy with the redrafting, I sent the file back to my co-author as an attachment to a short email.
        4. Life Management: For me, reading the NY Times is essential. It tells me what is going on in the world, how various op-ed writers feel about world events, and other useful reading including articles and columns in the Books Section and sometimes, the Science Section. This morning, Dennis Overbye, in his column “Out There,” reported that an announcement was forthcoming on the nature of the black hole, Sagittarius A*, at the center of our galaxy.
        5. Ideation and Recording: I need to think to edit a manuscript. I’m continually look- ing for ways to write to make my ideas clearer. It’s a back and forth with the page. I try something and if I like it, I move on. Otherwise, I try to rewrite.
        6. Life Management: As I was doing my editing, I was keeping my eye on the clock on my computer. I felt that leaving the computer at 8:15 would give me time to get cleaned up and get to the hospital.
        7. Life Management: The written directions on the front of the meter reminded me of how it worked.
        8. Life Management: I wrote the note and put in on the driver’s side dash so the parking attendant could see and read it. I was hoping that this might avert a ticket. I could have used a machine a block away but, as it was, I was late for my appointment.
        9. Life Management/Aide Memoire: When I arranged the appointment over the phone, the administrator gave me directions to get to Home Cardiographics and I wrote these out in a notebook. The night before, I transcribed the directions to a smaller piece of paper that I put in my pocket. I term this an Aide Memoire and it’s a lot like the gro- cery list my wife gives me when I go out shopping for her. It’s a way of remembering if my memory fails me.
        10. Life Management: I have to be able to recognize the written number 3 in order to get to the right floor.
        11. Life Management: Once I got to the third floor, I had to navigate to the right office and I did this by reading the signs on the doors and on the walls.
        12. Life Management: The attendant had to have literacy skills to take information from my health insurance card, and to administer the COVID screening questions to me (the list of questions was an Aide Memoire for her).
        13. Life Management: The attendant who installed the heart monitor and instructed me on what I had to do definitely needed literacy skills and I had to take the written instructions with me. For me, these were an Aide Memoire in case I forgot how to do it at some point over the two-week period.
        14. This point has nothing to do with literacy skills but it’s important. The moment I appeared uncertain as to which way to go when I got outside the door, the nurse anticipated that I would likely ask for directions and so gave them to me without me

        asking. It saved her some time and probably saved me a lot of time. As we will see later in the book, we are remarkable collaborators and this skill of the attendant’s— understanding exactly what was going on in my mind—is a skill that cognitive scien- tists have termed theory of mind.
        15. Life Management: I am familiar with common navigation signs and certainly a red “Elevator” sign is a common navigational sign in large buildings where there are lots of visitors (explorers).
        What this description makes clear is that literacy plays a big role in our cognitive life. To function as an adult in our advanced techno-literate societies, we need to be literate. Acquiring this skill is not cheap. We spend a lot of our early life in school and it’s here where we learn the literacy skills to function in our society.
        This description also makes clear that we use writing to think. Several of my entries are marked “Ideation” and it’s here where I am using my literacy skills to help me think. That’s what this book is about. I’m going to explain how we use literacy to support our imaginations when we use them to ideate.
        1.2 How Writing Helps Us Think
        I’ll begin by explaining my fortuitous observation. As I recall, I was sitting in my office working through a solution to an assignment I’d given my students. At one point I had to get the product 87.6 × 9.6. At that time, I normally used a spreadsheet for such arithmetic. But to do so would have required me to get up from my desk and walk over to the computer. I decided to work it out on the side of the sheet of paper I was working on. I soon had the answer: 87.6 × 9.6 = 840.96.
        Then it hit me. I realized that I couldn’t do this calculation in my head. If I just sat there, stared into space, and tried to get that product, I couldn’t do it. I could do simple products like 8 × 9 easily enough but not the more complex problem.
        The following weekend, I got up early on the Saturday morning when the house was quiet, parked myself in my easy chair, and tried to get 876 × 96 by just sitting and thinking it through.2 In Chapter 2, I’ll explain more about this experiment, but suffice it to say here that I almost got the right answer, and it took me about forty minutes. Most of us can do this problem with pencil and paper, but it’s much more difficult (impossible?) with our unassisted minds.
        I then started to think about why.
        Even though 876 × 96 = 84,096 is child’s play for most of us, it’s a very sophisticated idea that we didn’t come to overnight. Much of it, including the placeholder system of number representation and the arithmetic operations like multiplication, goes back about 4,000 years to the work of Babylonian scribes. More recently, we’ve been working on algorithms to do
        2 Rather than look at the shortcut 876 × 96 = 876 × (100 − 4) = 87,600 − 876 × 4, I stayed with brute force on 876 × 96.
        Chapter 1 Preliminaries 7
        
        8 Chapter 1 Preliminaries
        these products as efficiently as possible on machines. To date, David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven have discovered the most efficient method.3 For large integers, it works in a small fraction of the time required by the method we learned in primary school.
        But, for the moment, let’s consider 876 × 96 = 84,096 to be an idea. Forget about the 4,000 years of work to get to 876 × 96. Let’s just focus on starting with the product, 876 × 96, and then working to the idea, 876 × 96 = 84,096. To get it, we can execute the recipe we learned in primary school. As it turns out, this recipe is equivalent to a sequence of statements:
        6 × 6 = 36 / record 6 and carry 3
        6 × 7 + 3 = 45 / record 56 and carry 4 :
        78,840 + 5,256 = 84,096.
        The difficulty in executing these statements using only my unaided mind is that in order to do the last line (78,840 + 5,256 = 84,096), I have to remember the intermediate products, 78,840 and 5,256. These come from previous statements and I found I had trouble remembering them. If the numbers were just a little bit bigger to begin with, it would be impossible. So for me, the idea 876 × 96 = 84,096 is only discoverable with pen and paper.
        It’s not much of a stretch to suggest that the arguments to get to other ideas have a simi- lar structure. An argument is a logical sequence of statements that gets to an idea. Charles Darwin’s argument in The Origin of Species is simply a sequence of statements and this sequence eventually arrives at the idea of evolution by natural selection. Actually, we’re interested in how Darwin got to this argument before ever sitting down to write it out and I’ll address that issue in Chapter 2. We’ll never know exactly how this occurred but we do know that he worked for decades before eventually writing The Origin of Species. As you work through any argument, you’ll have to remember the results of previous statements to finish the statement you’re at, and for complex arguments like the arithmetic argument above, this is generally impossible. Hence, my observation that applies to arithmetic also applies to more general and complex ideas: I can’t discover certain ideas unless I have this technology of exographics.
        I can still remember the shock of that discovery. No teacher or professor had ever explained to me why I needed exographics to be able to discover certain kinds of ideas. Almost immediately I thought that maybe I had missed the lesson. But these many years later, it’s now clear to me it was never given.
        There is more we can say. For one, note that I have to use my hands to operate this tech- nology of pen and paper. The implication is that we need our hands to take full advantage of our imaginations. Second, we’ve developed a shared understanding of the symbols that we

        put on the page. When I write 78,840 + 5,256 = 84,096 on a page, you know what I mean and so does everybody else.
        Now let’s see what we can learn from other examples.
        Example 1
        The arithmetic example makes a subtle point. Most people are not prepared to concede they need an external technology like exographing to help them think. For example, consider this conversation I had with my sister, a lawyer. She asked me to tell her something interesting about the research I was doing. I thought for a moment and replied, “When you do seri- ous legal thinking, you always use your hands.” She looked at me like I had five heads and responded categorically that she used her head to think. I then asked her how she prepared for an important cross-examination, knowing that she would tell me she wrote it out on a legal pad with her favourite fountain pen. When she did, I came back with “So you use your hands to think.” She looked at me, thought for a moment, and said “I might use my hands, but my mind is telling my hands what to do. My head is driving the whole process.” “OK,” I said, “but what if I took away the pad and pen? Could you put together a cross-examination?” At this point a light bulb appeared to go on and she conceded my claim, remarking that she’d never really thought about it that way.
        This example has two important takeaways. First, it’s another example where, without exographing, certain kinds of ideas (a lawyer’s preparation for a cross-examination) are not discoverable. Second, my sister was under the mistaken impression that her mind alone was responsible for her thinking. This belief is not uncommon and is sometimes referred to as neurocentrism.
        Example 2
        William Stukeley, a contemporary of Isaac Newton (1642–1726 CE), related this about the great scientist’s walks on the grounds of Cambridge:
        . . . & when he took a turn in the fellows gardens, if some new gravel happen’d to be laid on the walks, it was sure to be drawn over, & over, with a bit of stick, in Sir Isaac’s diagrams; which the fellows would cautiously spare, by walking beside them. & there they would sometime remain for a good while.4
        Apparently, Newton was not averse to drawing in the mud to explore an idea. Why couldn’t one of the greatest minds this planet has produced have just kept walking and thinking to get his answers? Could it be that exographing enabled his imagination?
        4 William Stukeley, The Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s Life (London: The Royal Society, 1752), http://www.newtonproject. ox.ac.uk/catalogue/record/OTHE00001. The book is based on conversations Stukeley had with Humphrey Newton (no relation to Isaac Newton) and John Wickens, both friends of Newton. Wickens shared rooms with Newton at Cambridge for twenty years (1663–1683).

        10 Chapter 1 Preliminaries Example 3
        Albert Einstein (1879–1955 CE) was famous for his visual thought experiments and these informed his greatest insights. In part, Special Relativity was born of one involving two observers, a moving train, and two bolts of lightning. But these visualizations were just the start of his work. To get to Special Relativity from this visualization, he had to sit with a pen and paper and work through the mathematics the visualization suggested. A reading of any of the Einstein biographies makes it clear that there were many occasions when he was anxious to get back to his office to see if the mathematics of a vision would bear fruit. Clearly, Ein- stein needed exographing to discover Special Relativity.
        Example 4
        Mary Carruthers gives this account of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 CE).5 He was sitting next to King Louis XI of France at dinner one evening when he suddenly struck the table and exclaimed “That settles the Manichees!” He then called to his secretary “Reginald! Get up and write!” At the time, he was writing the Summa Theologica and it was his practice to “write” by dictating to secretaries. Aquinas’s abrupt behaviour would be unacceptable if he were dining with a friend. But with the King? It had to be that he was pretty sure he had sorted out the Manichees but, like Einstein, was desperate to check that his meditative thought made sense by writing out the argument in full. Aquinas required exographing to think through some of his ideas.
        Example 5
        Bono, the charismatic frontman of U2, is the band’s chief lyricist. He’s been responsible for the words to some of the most iconic songs in rock history. He is also a songwriter, meaning that he composes melodies. There is not much information on exactly how he creates but I’ve been able to piece together the following picture from various sources. His approach is largely a process where he experiments and builds snippets of the song as he goes. When he gets inspiration for what could be a good lyric snippet, he writes it down on whatever is available whether it be restaurant napkins, backs of envelopes, etc. This writing is simply a reliable way to store potential lyrics. The melding of lyrics and melody is experimental, trying this and that, until he gets something to work. As this process proceeds, the lyrics are written down for later readjustment as the lyric/mel- ody creation process unfolds. For Bono, exographing is an essential part of his creative process.
        The Importance of Imagination
        Let’s take stock. These examples suggest that some of our greatest thinkers required exo- graphing to discover their ideas. I don’t want to leave the impression that exographing is the main explanation for us getting to ideas because it’s not. Exographing is important but what
        5 Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 5.
        
        really makes the difference is our imaginations working on our internalized knowledge. To take full advantage of our imaginations and knowledge, we sometimes need exograph- ing. Borrowing terminology from logic, exographing is a necessary technology to be able to discover certain kinds of ideas. But it’s not sufficient. Exographing, by itself, doesn’t get you anything. But connect it to a fertile imagination and knowledge, and the three can do wonders.
        This brings me to the title of the book. In one version of the lore on unicorns, they’re fast, fierce, and elusive. Like unicorns, some ideas are difficult to capture. In fact, there are some ideas we can’t discover with just our naked imaginations. But we can if those imaginations are supported by exographing.
        1.3 The Relevant Literature The Ghost in the Machine
        Cartesian duality is the idea that each of us has a mind and body and that the body is the ser- vant of the mind. It dates at least to the Greek philosopher Plato who believed that, apart from our bodies, we had an eternal spirit. René Descartes (1596–1650 CE) saw the mind as not made of matter, but in the body and able to control matter. Over time, as we discovered more about how the brain worked and was structured, we came to view the physical brain and its associated electro-chemical neuronal network as the seat of all thought. The philosopher Gilbert Ryle (1900–1976 CE) signalled the end of duality with his famous characterization of Descartes’s concept of mind as “the Ghost in the Machine.”6
        Cognitive Artifacts
        I’ve argued that the cognitive skill of exographing is crucial for certain kinds of thinking. There are many other examples. When we are trying to figure out how to get from where we are to where we want to be, we sometimes use a map. We first locate our position on the map and then we look at our surroundings to orient these surroundings with the representation in the map. Once we do these two things, we can begin to make decisions about how to get to the place we want to be. The map, an exographic, is crucial to navigation. There are some famous examples. One is Harry Beck’s map of the London Tube System. It in no way reflects the actual distances between stops but it’s excellent for navigating the system.
        For thousands of years, Micronesians, without instruments, were able to sail between islands thousands of miles apart. Ben Finney describes this astounding skill in this way:
        The navigational practices of Oceanians present somewhat of a puzzle to the student of the history of cartography. Here were superb navigators who sailed their

        canoes from island to island, spending days or sometimes many weeks out of sight of land, and who found their way without consulting any instruments or charts at sea. Instead, they carried in their head images of the spread of islands over the ocean and envisioned in the mind’s eye the bearings from one to the other in terms of a conceptual compass whose points were typically delineated according to the rising and setting of key stars and constellations or the directions from which named winds blow. Within this mental framework of islands and bearings, to guide their canoes to destinations lying over the horizon these navigators applied vital information obtained by watching with the naked eye the stars, ocean swells, steady winds, island-influenced cloud formations, land-nesting birds fishing out at sea, and other cues provided by nature.7
        This is a remarkable achievement. Sailors used the night sky and other artifacts to navigate for days over vast distances between small islands.
        To cook a dish, professional chefs will prepare its ingredients ahead of time and then put them in the order they go into the pot. This saves them having to check all aspects of the written recipe as they cook.8
        To teach arithmetic, a primary school teacher often has students use manipulatives. For example, to learn how to do simple subtraction problems, say 5 − 2, a child will begin with 5 counters (a uniform object like disks or chips) and then remove 2 counters to arrive at the answer, 3. Eventually the child will internalize the problem and manipulatives are no longer required.
        Bartenders, upon getting an order, will immediately place the various kinds of glasses required on the bar-rail. In part, these glasses serve as a mnemonic for the bartender to fill the order. This is because there are only so many kinds of drinks that you can put into, say, a Collins glass. As the drinks are mixed, the liquid in the glasses also serves as mnemonic. Inter- estingly, very experienced bartenders outgrow these mnemonics. When they get to this point, they can focus on conversations with patrons, something that leads to higher tips, on average.9
        Embodied Thought
        In the last thirty years, we’ve come around to the view that our cognition depends upon neural processes, bodily processes, and artifacts in the environment. We have a number of terms for this including embodied thought, cognitive integration, the extended mind, mate- rial engagement theory, and cognitive offloading. All of these descriptions take the view that our thinking is sometimes enhanced by artifacts in the environment. I am going to use the

        terms embodied thought or embodied mind over the remainder of this book. At times I will refer to the contrast in beliefs about where thinking takes place. One side of the debate argues that all cognitive activity resides in our heads. This position is sometimes called neurocen- trism (or internalism). The other side, which argues that our cognition also requires bodily processes and artifacts in the environment, is termed cognitive integration and those who believe it are termed cognitive integrationists.
        My reading of the literature suggests that Merlin Donald was the first to think about the role of writing in the evolution of the human mind. In his 1991 book, Origins of the Modern Mind, he posited three developmental stages (episodal, mimetic, and symbolic), and in the last stage—the symbolic stage—advanced to symbolic thought (speech and writing), a change he referred to as the exographic revolution. In this book, he originated the concept of an exogram, and defined it to be “an external memory record of an idea.”10 He also suggested the term exographics as a synonym for exogram. I will have more to say about both these and particularly the contrast between the exogram and engram (defined to be the biological stor- age of a piece of information) as I develop the concept of abstract idea reification in Chapter 2. Donald is firmly in the camp of cognitive integration.
        Donald Norman also recognized the power of exographing in ideation and this paragraph is one that should have drawn more attention than it did:
        The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated. Without external aids, memory, thought, and reasoning are all constrained. But human intelligence is highly flexible and adaptive, superb at inventing procedures and objects that overcome its own limits. The real powers come from devising external aids that enhance cognitive abilities. How have we increased memory, thought, and reasoning? By the invention of external aids: It is things that make us smart. Some assistance comes through cooperative social behavior; some arises through exploitation of the information present in the environment; and some comes through the development of tools of thought—cognitive artifacts—that complement abilities and strengthen mental powers. ... Probably the most important of our external aids are paper, pencil, and the corresponding skills of reading and writing. But because we tend to notice the unique, not the commonplace, few recognize them for the powerful tools that they are, nor does the average person realize what breakthroughs in reasoning and technology were required to invent writing, numerical representations, portable and reliable pens and pencils, and inexpensive, functional writing paper.11
        This paragraph is a clear statement of embodied thinking. Note that Norman also suggests that we don’t appreciate the power of exographing because it’s so endemic. He begins by noting that

        our thinking minds have some pretty serious limitations. But happily, we were smart enough to invent technologies like exographing that enabled us to overcome some of these weaknesses. Edwin Hutchins looked at distributed cognition, how individuals formed cognitive sys- tems where the individuals within such a system generally engaged in embodied cognition. In his book Cognition in the Wild, he presents a detailed study of the cognitive systems used aboard a Navy ship.12 A good modern example are the systems large ships use to berth. Such berthing requires the coordination of many individuals including those on the ship’s bridge, those in tugboats, and those who will engage the ship’s mooring system to secure the vessel to its berth. This system is distributed and many cognitive artifacts are used. As I will explain later in this development, I think Hutchins’s work was critical because it got us thinking about the importance of the embodied mind in a network of imaginations which, to me, is
        the signature accomplishment of our species.
        The title of Hutchins’s book, Cognition in the Wild, is a remarkable turn of phrase. At the
        time he wrote the book, symbolic computational theories of the mind were in vogue. Cogni- tive scientists saw the mind as essentially a computer that worked on symbolically coded information stored in the mind. Hutchins’s observations of the way we actually thought (i.e., cognition in the wild) suggested that there was more to the nature of our thinking processes than in-mind symbolic computation.
        David Kirsh asks why we have a tendency to build an external representation of some- thing we are trying to understand.13 Just as Newton drew in the mud, some of us pick up a pencil and paper to try and figure something out. For example, consider this problem drawn from the Ladies’ Journal of 1707:
        If to my age there added be
        One half, one third, and three times three; Six score and ten the sum you’ld see,
        Pray find out what my age may be.
        I would go right to pen and paper to solve this problem.14 The interesting question, Kirsh sug- gests, is “. . .why do people do more than just think in their heads?”15
        David Chalmers and Andy Clark begin with this question: “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?”16 They suggest that some “accept the demarcations of skin and skull, and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind.” They disagree and argue that “cognitive processes ain’t (all) in the head!” The classic justification is a relatively com- plicated arithmetic problem like the one discussed above. Chalmers and Clark would refer to the system of the human, the pencil and paper as a “coupled system.” Clark subsequently

        presents a more complete description of his ideas in his books Supersize the Mind and Nat- ural-Born Cyborgs, and a number of other publications.17 He argues that we are cyborgs by nature and the human mind has never been “bound and restricted by the biological skin-bag . . . the ancient fortress of skin and skull.”18 Of course, his position has not been without controversy. The main objection, that I can see, is that some philosophers don’t like attribut- ing cognition to a pencil and some paper. For my work, I really don’t need to wade into this debate. I’m happy to recognize that artifacts like a pencil and paper enable us to discover ideas we otherwise couldn’t and leave it at that.
        There have been other important contributors. As a result of the abject early failures of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Rodney Brooks suggested that “we should build complete intel- ligent systems that we let loose in the real world with real sensing and real actions.”19 He is advocating machines whose thought is embodied. Francisco Varela, Eleanor Rosch, and Evan Thompson wrote an important early book grounding the embodied mind in human experience.20 Lambros Malafouris has proposed his version of embodied thinking: Material Engagement Theory.21 Karenleigh Overmann has done important work on the embodied thinking related to the origins of numbers.22 I will appeal to her work when I look at abstrac- tion in the next chapter. Richard Menary has offered an excellent synthesis of the implica- tions of cognitive integration for writing and thinking.23 Other important contributions are the connectionist theories of David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the PDP Research Group.24 As I remarked above, the dominant view of the working mind in the 1980s was sym- bolic computation. In contrast, Rumelhart et al. thought of the mind as having a massively parallel structure based on neural networks. As we will see, our mimicking of this structure in mathematical models has led to significant breakthroughs in deep learning, a topic I will tackle later in the book.
        Another useful construct for my argument is cognitive offloading as described by Evan Risko and Sam Gilbert.25 They define it to be the use of bodily action to reduce the cognitive demands of an information processing requirement. In the arithmetic problem above, I am essentially using pen and paper to expand my working memory.

        I’ll close with an observation. Despite this significant literature on the role of writing in ideation, there are pockets of scholars who do not seem to recognize it. For example, there is not a single paper covering it in The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning.26
        1.4 This Book’s Main Contributions
        The embodied mind literature suggests that we’re not able to discover certain kinds of ideas without exographing. At the same time, exographing is certainly not required for all ideation. For example, consider the invention of yarn. Yarn is basically thread and can be made from a variety of natural and man-made materials. One material is the wool of sheep. Over our his- tory, sheep have been an extremely valuable resource. They can survive in a variety of climates and geographies and can turn just about any vegetation into meat. In addition, they are a source of wool. When shorn and cleaned, the wool is a tangled mass of short fibres, each perhaps two to three inches long. These fibers have a microscopic physical structure such that when two or more are twisted together they make an extremely strong yarn. In ancient times, women used a device called a drop spindle to twist these fibres together. Rather than me explain what a drop spindle is and how it works, I suggest you look at a YouTube video (use the search phrase “drop spindle operation”). These devices are amazing. In fact, it boggles my mind how we came up with such ideas. Obviously, we’d been using woolen sheep hides to make clothes for a long time. What a bright idea to shear these sheep and use the shorn wool to make yarn, then fabric, and then clothes. Over time, we made increasingly better and more complex machines to do all
        these fundamental transformations.
        Another example is the atlatl, a device our ancient ancestors innovated to throw a spear
        more accurately and at a higher speed. Its operation is shown in the following diagram:

        São Paulo. Sá. 2014, 403 p.
        
        Note that it’s basically an extension of the thrower’s arm and this is where the added speed comes from. The atlatl is certainly evidence of our imagination and ingenuity and we came up with it long before we ever started to write.
        So the question is this: why do we need exographing to discover some ideas but not oth- ers? This book’s purpose is to answer the question and then explore its implications.
        Contribution 1. Exographing Gives Us a Way to Reify Abstract
        Concepts and Ideas
        There is no such thing as the number twenty-three in the real world. It’s not like ducks and baseball bats, concrete objects that we can reach out and touch. Our imaginations have brought it into existence through our symbolic ability. We can say “twenty-three” and we can write it on a page (usually “23” but sometimes “twenty-three” or “XXIII”). This reification via exographing brings “23” into our visual field where we’re able to manipulate it and other numbers much as we did stone to make tools 2.5 million years ago. We’ve had a long history of manipulating concrete objects in our visual fields with our hands. Manipulating symbolic concepts on a written page is not much different. The number “23” on a page is just as concrete as ducks and baseball bats. Hence exographing enables this reification of abstract concepts where we are then able to manipulate them to arrive at ideas like 876 × 96 = 84,096.
        Contribution 2. Without Exographing We Can’t Measure
        Just think of the tremendous reach of measurement in our economic life. We have incomes measured in dollars, and we spend these incomes on various quantities of goods, each with a price. Business firms measure their costs, revenues, and profits. The stock market has thousands of equities trading in prices that fluctuate minute to minute. We measure how well the economy does as a whole with GDP. There are a number of measures of money supply and we can borrow various amounts from lenders at various interest rates. These measures constitute just a small part of the economic measurement we do.
        Within science and engineering, the list is just about without limit. The Millau Viaduct in France is one of the largest bridges in the world and its design and construction were marvels of measurement. The moon landing in 1969 took an extraordinary amount of measurement.
        Considering other aspects of our life, we measure blood pressure and batting averages. We identify the time of day with a digital measurement. The calendar date is also a measure- ment. Our ages are measured in years. The government assigns us numbers for identification purposes. My golf clubs are numbered and these correspond to the distances I can hit the ball with each club. When I cook, I make a lot of measurements, especially when I want to restrict my caloric intake. We measure a President’s approval rating. If you read the NY Times, it’s very difficult to find an article which does not include some reference to a statistic or measurement. All this to say, if we wrote down all of what we measured, it would be a long list.
        Chapter 1 Preliminaries 17

        18 Chapter 1 Preliminaries
        Let me argue the necessity of exographing for measurement. To be able to measure as we do today, we need a good number system. We’ve been developing number systems for a long time. In fact, we started to develop them about the same time we invented exographing. As I’ll describe later, exographing was invented to solve the administrative problems associ- ated with the agricultural exchange economies that developed in the ancient city-states of Mesopotamia. In these settlements, the administrators had to keep track of who owed what to the temple and palace, and keeping track of it with just human memory became impos- sible. Hence exographing was invented to relieve the cognitive problems associated with transactionally intensive economies. Furthermore, our first attempts at exographing (proto- writing) were at best short inscriptions describing transactions. They were definitely not used to record language in sentences and paragraphs.
        But this proto-writing did give us the ability to define sophisticated number systems, including operations with those numbers (addition, subtraction, etc.) If you look at societies without writing systems, their number systems are simple. Most of them use just four quanti- ties: none, 1, 2, and many. Some are more sophisticated but not much.27 So the logic is simple: measurement requires a number system, and to discover and use a sophisticated number system requires exographing. The implication is that any sort of sophisticated measurement requires the technology of exographing.
        I plan to go over the early history of the invention of numbers. As we will see, the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia used small tokens as counters. We don’t know exactly how these systems worked but we know enough about them to say that these early systems were mate- rial in nature.28 Much as a child learns about numbers with manipulatives, our ancestors used three-dimensional counters to do their accounting measurements. In effect, this is embodied thinking using material artifacts. Over time, these ancient accountants graduated from three- dimensional tokens to two-dimensional symbolic notations on clay tablets.
        Contribution 3. Conceptualizing the Ideasphere and Reconsidering
        “The Great Divide”
        The fundamental concept of my development will be the idea. Before we actually produce something like a smart phone, there has to be a lot of thinking and this thinking leads to ideas which in turn ultimately lead to cultural artifacts like smart phones.
        We’re astonishingly good at generating ideas. The archeological evidence is clear that we began making stone tools about 2.5 million years ago. Progress was slow for hundreds of thousands of years. But around the time of the Agricultural Revolution about 12,000 years ago, our ideation intensity really picked up. My plan is to characterize this ideation and how it’s grown.
        27 For example, later in the book, I’ll document the number system of the Oksapmin people of Papua New Guinea. Their number system comprises the first 29 integers and each number is associated with a body part. Hence, in order to have the more complicated system and deal with it cognitively, the Oksapmin have grounded their system in a visual representation.
        28 The interested reader is referred to the excellent work of Karenleigh Overmann: The Material Origins of Numbers (Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2019).
        
        The anthropologist Wade Davis defined the Ethnosphere to be “the sum total of all thoughts and intuitions, myths and beliefs, ideas and inspirations brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.”29 My definition of the Ideasphere is a slight variation. Since all cultural objects begin as ideas, I define the Ideasphere to be the sum total of all ideas brought into being by the human imagination.
        This definition and the recognition that certain ideas require exographing to discover lead naturally to a partition of the Ideasphere into the A Class (ideas that require exographing to discover) and the C Class (ideas which don’t require exographing to discover).
        I then outline the structure of the A Class (what’s in it, what’s not, and the interrelation- ships among these ideas). I’ll argue that the A Class includes the material artifacts of modern life in a techno-literate society, things like computer technology, the Internet, MRI machines, aircraft, and knowledge of the human genome. I’ll then describe how the A Class has grown exponentially over the last 500 years and then suggest that there is no reason to believe that this exponential growth will not continue. Later in the book, I’ll argue that two of our hard- wired characteristics are largely responsible for this growth. One is our enormous curiosity. The other is the so-called ratchet effect, this remarkable ability we have to notice a good idea and then try to improve it.
        Having defined the A and C Classes, I’ll then wade into a discussion of the root causes of “The Great Divide,” Jack Goody’s name for the vast differences between modern techno- literate societies and oral indigenous societies. Initially, scholars like Goody, Walter Ong, and Eric Havelock explained the difference with exographics. This spawned a significant reaction with most scholars now taking the position that the early scholars were wrong and that the explanation involves education among other factors. I believe that our new understanding of embodied thinking and our use of material cognitive artifacts allows us to argue that exographing is a significant part of the explanation of The Great Divide, and I’ll make that argument in detail.
        Contribution 4. Explaining the Origin of Our Massively Literate
        Education System
        Cultural transmission to the next generation is critical in all societies. Here I’ll appeal to the work of a number of scholars but most especially to the work of Robert Boyd, Peter Richer- son, and Joseph Henrich.30 I’ll begin by looking at cultural transmission in oral indigenous

        societies. These societies have had to be exceedingly clever in C Class ideation to be able to flourish in their surroundings. I’ll focus on the Inuit who have survived for thousands of years in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. For these societies, the younger generation needs to understand all aspects of hunting, transportation, shelter, and energy to name just a few things on a long list, and this transmission is usually accomplished with a “learn-by-doing” system.
        In the same way, there must be a cultural transfer to the younger generation in our techno-literate societies. One of our primary ways of doing this is to send our children to school for a considerable period of time to learn the exographing technology and the asso- ciated cultural knowledge that comes with it. There are other aspects of this education, but a literate education is critical for younger people to be able to function in our societies as adults. As time has passed, our education system has become more complex because of our continued expansion of the A Class and the expanding complexity of our societies. In addition, our education system is very much a “learn-by-doing” approach. To learn how to print the letter “a” for example, young primary school students practise doing it. A university student learns calculus by studying examples. Much of our education system is “learn-by-doing.”
        Here’s the important point. Would we need these massively literate education systems if we had not invented exographing? Surely not! Our modern massively literate education systems have only arisen because we invented exographing.
        Contribution 5. Assessing the Evidence That Enhancements to Exographing Technologies Lead to Significant Increases in A Class Ideation
        In Part II of the book, I’ll look at the long history of exographing and its association with
        A Class expansion. All things equal, we would expect that improvements in exographing technology would lead to A Class expansion. Take for example what happened in ancient Greece. These Greeks perfected a phonetic writing system that was easier to learn than the pictographic/logographic systems that arose in other cultures. This, combined with the Greek belief in a democratic education system (at least for males), resulted in more A Class capability which, in turn, led to an explosion in A Class ideas including ideas in philosophy, mathematics, science, astronomy, literature, drama, and poetry. Overall, the evidence I’ll present in Part II suggests that improvements in exographing technologies played a significant role in the expansion of the A Class.
        Contribution 6. Assessing the Future of Ideation Technologies and
        the Ideasphere
        The conventional wisdom is that we are now well down the road of trying to reproduce the ide- ation abilities of our networked minds with machines. By some accounts, this “singularity” is not far off. But I have my doubts. To make the point, I’ll look at some cases of our substantial

        A Class ideation. One example is the Wright Brothers and their discovery of the principles of powered flight. Theirs was a story of multi-year experimentation with flyer designs and flight-control surfaces that eventually gave them the principles of the control of powered flight. It is very difficult to imagine how machines would be able to replicate their work, much less work that would result in some new technology that adds as much as what the Wrights discovered. Their work constituted genius-level embodied thinking. In principle, it ought to be doable because, as Rodney Brooks has suggested: “We already have an existence proof ... human beings.”31 But we’re going to need a much better understanding of how net- worked embodied thinking works.
        A second consideration is whether there are other technologies besides exographing that will enable us to make inroads in the Ideasphere. Up to the invention of exographing, our ideation was restricted to the C Class. But with exographing, we were able to discover the A Class. My question is whether there are other technologies, possibly ones we’ve yet to invent, that will enable us to open up another class of ideas, a class I call the X Class. Since our ability to ideate is so tied to our vision, it could be that the next important technologies are ones that enhance our vision. Alternatively, it could be technologies which enhance our col- laboration in some way, a path we are already pursuing with the growth of the Internet and our search capability of it. At the moment, these are just conjectures.
        Contribution 7. The Case for a Discipline Which Studies the
        Technology of Exographing
        We live in societies steeped in literacy and exographics. All of us spent a lot of time learning the three Rs. You begin, quite early, to learn how to recognize the letters of the alphabet by name, how to print them, and how to sound them. Next you learn to recognize words and finally you start to read and then progress to more difficult texts over time. You also begin to learn how to write, the skill of translating your thoughts to the page. All of this is to prepare you to participate in a highly literate society.
        Certainly, exographing is fundamental to college and university study. Students use it to take class notes, to do rough work as they put together assignments and essays, to record lab results, to write exams, and so on. Professors use it extensively in teaching and especially in their research. Exographing is endemic to every subject you could possibly study at university.
        The other side of exographing is reading. When reading, we’re generally embracing someone else’s ideas.
        I believe that all students would benefit from a course in the fundamental technology they use to think. It would explain embodied thinking, the Ideasphere and its partition into the A and C Classes, the fundamentals of individual thought, the fundamentals of our collaborative networked thought, the history of the exographing technology and how it’s impacted ideation, the role of writing/literacy in education, the role of exographing in
        Chapter 1 Preliminaries 21

        22 Chapter 1 Preliminaries
        explaining the marked differences between those societies with and without exographing, and our disastrous attempts to take the technology to oral peoples.
        Finally, I think it’s important to give students a balanced appreciation for the effects of the technology. On the one hand, it’s given us a powerful tool to discover ideas we otherwise couldn’t, and this has given rise to our advanced techno-literate societies. But on the other, it’s spawned a number of problems, including inequality and particularly economic inequal- ity, war and destruction on a global scale, genocide, and the wherewithal to destroy the planet (nuclear proliferation and climate degradation).
        1.5 Collaboration and Communication
        I’ll close this chapter by suggesting what I believe to be the “secret sauce” of our ideation ability.
        We’re a pretty special ape by any measure. We’ve settled the planet, gone to the moon, and explored our wider solar system with machines and telescopes that report back to us. We’ve built computers, smart phones, and the Internet. We’ve produced great works of art, literature, and music. We invented democracy, markets, money, systems of justice, and systems of education. We can heal many of our ailments and have extended our lifespans by decades.
        Yet our closest biological relative, the chimpanzee, still lives in the wild doing pretty much what it did millions of years ago. In fact, it wasn’t that long ago in evolutionary time that we were sitting in the trees with them. What happened?
        One explanation is that we’ve evolved a significant intelligence. But when you get down to it and look at most of us closely, we’re not that impressive. When it comes to the necessities of life, I don’t grow or hunt the food I eat. I didn’t build the house I live in or the car I drive to work. I don’t make my clothes or my shoes or my golf clubs. I certainly didn’t build the computer I work on every day. What I can do is applied mathematics, a skill that makes me a decent living.
        The implication is clear enough. At least a part of the explanation for our distinctiveness is our remarkable ability to collaborate. The Apollo 11 mission took 300,000 of us working together for the better part of a decade. Some would argue that it took a lot more of us work- ing for thousands of years. Whatever measure you like, that’s a lot of cooperation, especially relative to other species.
        What helps enable this uber-cooperation is communication, our ability to transfer our ideas from one to another with precision. It’s not clear how we came to speech. How- ever, we know much more about how we came to exographing and I’ll document that later in the book. What’s important to point out here is that, when it comes to ideation, exographing provides additional communication flexibility. We now have access to a great history of ideation over the Internet. Moreover, we’re able to share and search that history quickly and efficiently. In short, exographing, like speech, enables collaboration on a massive scale.

        Finally, we tend to think of ideation as a solitary exercise, one where a scholar goes off, does his or her thinking, and hatches an idea. The poster-boys are Newton, Einstein, and Darwin. Yes, this solitary thinking is important. Each of these great scholars was socially constructed. They were raised within a literate education system, a system that took them from learning their ABCs to the frontiers of knowledge. And it is only then that they kicked their socially constructed minds into gear to do their great work. Our mind-sharing ability is, by a wide margin, our most important ideation support skill.
        Yes, it’s you and me. But, more importantly, it’s us.

The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated.
Donald Norman
Generally-writing is thought of as a means of communication, one that is different from speaking since written messages can be delivered over space and time. However, there has not been as much research on the use of writing to think. In this chapter, I explore the ratio- nale for writing as a form of external memory in the thinking process. I’ll go over the details of the argument that certain kinds of ideas are not discoverable without writing.
From there, I’ll define the Ideasphere, the collection of all the ideas we’ve had since the beginning of human consciousness. Since some ideas require writing to discover, I’ll look at a partition of the Ideasphere into A Class ideas, those ideas that required writing to discover, and the C Class, those ideas that did not require writing to discover. Over this and several succeeding chapters, I’ll argue that the A Class is now a vast set and includes many of the ideas and artifacts that we see in our advanced techno-literate societies.
I’ll begin with a definition of exographics.
2.1 Defining Exographics
The word “writing” has different meanings depending on the context. For instance, linguists think of a “writing system” as one whose defining purpose is the representation of speech. The technical term for such writing is glottographic writing. Writing also means producing a text like a novel. For primary schoolers, it means practicing their printing.
Ignace Gelb wrote one of the first books on what we might term the science of writing.1 Basically he saw writing as a means of communication rather than as a tool of thought. But he wasn’t as restrictive as the linguists. His first chapter is entitled “A System of Signs” and in it, he writes: “However, the general statement that full writing expresses speech should not be taken to mean that it expresses nothing else but speech.”2 He admits the possibility of

writing including mathematics notation and other kinds of non-speech representation but he is clearly focussed on writing as a tool of communication.
What I need is a definition of writing that describes our ability to inscribe any symbol on a visual medium. I want it to include things like mathematics notation, music notation, choreo- graphical notation, sketches, data tables, pictures, and basically any visual symbol set that helps thinkers discover an idea. The type of writing that also includes non-speech representations is called semasiographic writing. Rather than give an explicit definition of writing that includes both glottographic and semasiographic components, I felt the better course was to use a new word.
There have been a variety of terms suggested for the representation of thought on a visual medium external to the mind. One is external representation. Another is TEXT as defined by Elaine Treharne and Claude Willan.3 Karl Lashley defined an engram to be a memory record stored inside the human nervous system.4 For example, our long-term memory record “2+3=5” is an engram. In contrast, Merlin Donald defined an exogram to be a memory record stored outside the nervous system.5 For example, my wife’s written list of items I take to the grocery store is an exogram. If a music composer records a promising chord sequence on a smart phone, the recording is an exogram. In a subsequent paper, Donald uses the terms exogram and exographics interchangeably. I’ll put the term exographics at the heart of my argument and define it this way:
Definition. An exographic is a set of persistent meaningful symbols (words, pictures, graphs, etc.) stored on a visible medium usually for the purpose of ideation. Exographing is the act of inscribing these representations on the medium.
So an exographic could be glottographic or semasiographic writing and you can think of exographing as the writing you do to produce exographics. The root word of “exographics” is “graphic” meaning some sort of visual representation. The prefix “exo” means “out of” and, in this case, “out of the mind.”
The Notion of Persistence
An important concept in the definition is that exographics are persistent, meaning they are sta- tionary over time. You can stare at a page of exographics and the symbols on that page do not move. They are motionless and you can look at them for as long as you want. Contrast that to the content of speech which “disappears” almost as quickly as it is spoken. Speech is ephemeral.
Perhaps the best way to understand persistence is to look at examples of text that are not persistent. For example, in videos with subtitles, the words a speaker says appear simultane- ously on the screen as text and disappear shortly after they are spoken. In this way, these

Behavior (Society’s Symposium IV) (Cambridge: Academic Press, 1950).

 vard University Press, 1991).

visual words have the same characteristic as the aural words: cognitively, they vanish after they are spoken. We pick up the narrative’s gist but we certainly don’t remember the exact words. This makes doing something like mathematics difficult. Mathematics, by its nature, requires that we see the detail for enough time to understand it. Hence, if a string of math- ematical symbols were running across a video screen, we would have to stop the video in order to study the details.
Another example is a person using sign language. This is certainly symbolic output in our visual field but it is hardly persistent. The words disappear cognitively in the same way spoken words do.
Roman Jakobson was the first to emphasize the importance of persistence.6 Certainly some scholars did not seem to understand the nature of exographics being persistent. For example, Eric Havelock wrote this: “The eye can review, that is, retrospect: the ear and mouth cannot.”7 As the example of movie subtitles makes clear, the eye cannot always review visual text. Hence persistence is not inherent in our cognitive skill set but rather it is a char- acteristic: of the medium we choose to present the symbols.
Some time ago, I coached university football in Canada on the defensive side of the ball. A big part of coaching is figuring out what an opposing offence is doing. On game day, this is very difficult. In Canadian football, you have to look at 12 opposing players. Seeing what each does on plays that average 6 seconds in length is a cognitive impossibility. Fortunately, at the time I coached, the rules required teams to trade video recordings of their last three games. We could then use these recordings to figure out what our next opponent was doing. We basically studied what every offensive player did on every play. To figure out, say, what the left tackle was doing on a play, we would roll the video-tape over and over, sometimes in slow-motion. The beauty of the tape is that the play becomes persistent. What might have taken 6 seconds in real time, takes about 10–15 minutes to analyze by running and re-running the tape. So just because something is in our visual frame doesn’t mean it’s persistent.
The industrialist Leland Stanford (he and his wife founded Stanford University) had a keen interest in horses and gait analysis. At the time, it was not known whether all of a horse’s feet were ever off the ground when running. In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge was able to take a quick series of photographs of one of Stanford’s horses and some of these showed clearly that the horse’s feet were all off the ground. The human eye is not able to discern this because the horse’s legs move too quickly. Yet, with the camera, reality becomes persistent.
Types of Exographics
There are two types. One is the finished exographics we do to communicate ideas to oth- ers. It could be a paper in a journal, a book, or a composer’s finished sheet music. There is also rough exographics, which is the non-formal writing we do as we work through an idea.

It would include, say, the notes a historian makes at an archive, the rough work a mathematician does to arrive at a theorem, the lab notes a chemist makes while doing an experiment, and the initial sketches of an architect to arrive at a design proposal. Basically, rough exographics are used in the ideation process and finished exographics for communicating the idea.
Let’s now clarify these types with some examples. Here is a snippet of Einstein’s rough exographics leading to his paper on special relativity:8
Note that his famous equation E=mc2 is displayed. You can tell this is rough exographics because it’s handwritten and one of the words on the bottom line is crossed out.
The following diagram by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1590 CE) is believed to be the first exploded-view sketch of a machine:

  Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1590)
 
This is rough exographics because it’s done by hand.
Here are the first three paragraphs of a draft of Charles Dickens’s (1812–1870) A
Christmas Carole:9
This is clearly a rough exographic. Here are the same paragraphs as a finished exographic:
STAVE I MARLEY’S GHOST
MARLEY was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge’s name was good upon ‘Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.
Old Marley was as dead as adoor-nail.
Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
When a thinker is working through an idea, they will be producing rough exographics. It is only when the idea is complete that we would see a finished exographic. For example, a mathematician might produce pages of rough exographics working through examples to see a general pattern in the problem she is studying. It might be that these pages of rough exographics lead to only a single paragraph in the finished exographic of the idea. For this

reason, I like the analogy of an iceberg. The finished exographic is the part of the iceberg you see above the water, and all of the thinking and rough exographics that go into discovering the idea is that part you don’t see below the water.
The Craft of Finished Exographics
As students, you’ve been asked to produce many finished exographics. Whether it’s a his- tory essay, a book review for an English class, a mathematics assignment, or a chemistry lab report, your instructors have asked you to compose a finished exographic that is coherent and well written. Very often, the requirement is to write sentences and paragraphs. As you no doubt appreciate, this is a difficult skill to acquire. It takes a lot of practice to be able to produce good prose. As I see it, it’s one of the most important skills you will develop as you move through your education. Effectively, you’re learning to write, and as I have argued above, this skill is intimately related to your ability to think.
Writing a decent sentence is an exercise in logic. A student once submitted this sen- tence to me in response to a writing exercise asking them to describe what they read for pleasure:
I enjoy reading autobiographies of people.
In one sense, this is a good sentence because I understand the idea the student is trying to convey. But in another, it’s not. There is no need for the words “reading” and “of people” since autobiographies are always read and are always about people. As it turned out, the student meant “biographies” rather than “autobiographies.” Hence, the sentence could have been written:
I enjoy biographies.
which is the same idea as the original with half the words. Basically, you need to look at any sentence you’ve written and make two assessments:
Does this sentence convey the idea I intended? and
Is there a way to write it with fewer words?
When my answer to the first question is no, I often don’t know how to change the sentence to get the desired result. I find this fascinating: my mind can easily conclude that a given sen- tence doesn’t express what I want to convey but, at the same time, I sometimes have no idea how to fix it. This is the hard part of writing. As for the second question, the more you prac- tice, the better you will get at changing the words so that fewer are required. For example, rather than “at this point in time,” you could write “now.”
I’ll not have much to say about finished exographics as there are many good books available on how to write well.

2.2 Ideation Technics
Exographics are two-dimensional visual representations that help us to discover ideas. But as the literature on embodied thinking makes clear, we use many kinds of artifacts in the environment to help us think. When an artifact is a part of the process to help us think, I’m going to refer to it as an ideation technic. An exographic is a special case of ideation technic. Another example is an electronic calculator. Still another is Computer Aided Design (CAD), the software codes that allow engineers and architects to do design work much more quickly than if they were doing it by hand.
Gaudí’s Approach to Architectural Design
The Spanish architect, Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926 CE), is famous for a number of structures, most notably the Sagrada Familia Basilica in Barcelona. Even though it’s not yet complete, it is breathtakingly beautiful.
Basically, an architect has two problems. He or she wants to make sure a proposed struc- ture is structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing. These days, most architects leave the issue of whether a building will stand to structural engineers. But Gaudí was able to assess both aspects with his “hanging chain” models (a three-dimensional exogram). He began with a scaled floor plan on a board that he attached to a ceiling. He then suspended weights from strings hanging down from the board. Here is a picture of the hanging chain model for the Sagrada Familia:
Once the model was constructed, he took pictures of it and then turned the pictures upside down to see what it would look like. This technique allowed him to judge the effects of changes in design quickly. Architects have used scaled 3D models of their proposed structures

since the Renaissance. But Gaudí took it to a new level with his approach. This hanging chain
model is an ideation technic.
Matthew Bourne’s Approach to Choreography
Choreographers work in remarkably similar says to music composers. Matthew Bourne, the celebrated British choreographer, will experiment with dancers over a two-week period. At his direction, he films perhaps a hundred phrases and snippets with the dancers sometimes making suggestions to Bourne as the experiment proceeds. Then, with this collection of video clips, he “connects” them into a larger piece. He does live experiments along the way to see what a combination of these snippets looks like. His preferred compositional medium— videotape—is an ideation technic. While some choreographers use exographics (pictures of sequential foot movements on a page) to record movement, Bourne does not because he is forever tinkering with a piece. The video is an ideation technic.
2.3 Imagination
I live in a small city on the northern shore of Lake Ontario. It can get pretty cold in the winter so sometimes I like to take an imaginary trip to a warmer place. Most of the time it’s to Paris. In my mind’s eye, it’s a late Sunday morning in early May, the sun is shining, and it’s unseasonably warm. My wife and I have just walked from our apartment in the Marais to the Bastille and we’re seated at an outdoor bistro surrounded by Parisians and other visi- tors who’ve also been drawn out by a perfect day. We sit and chat idly, taking in the sun, the warmth, and the people. Usually, this trip only lasts a few minutes but it’s a nice refuge when the reality outside is thirty below. The important point about this sketch is that I can bring it up on demand.
In fact, the distinguishing feature of our species is how we process information. As nearly as we can tell, we’re the only species who can imagine different worlds on demand and then communicate the details of those worlds to others.
Newton imagined a phantasm called gravity, his concept for the glue that holds the uni- verse together. Shakespeare imagined the tragic story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Our deep ancestors imagined that a useful tool could be had by chipping one stone with another. All of us can imagine alternative realities. For example, suppose you have an important one-on-one meeting with your superior in several day’s time about the new project you’ve been pushing. In preparation, you are likely to simulate in your mind the possible paths this meeting could take, as well as forecast the concerns and questions your superior is likely to have. Your superior will likely be going through the same sort of preparation. Imagination is a powerful skill.
This book will focus on how we exploit our imaginations with exographics. We’ll begin by outlining two of our important skills in ideation supported by exographics: symbolic rep- resentation and abstraction.

Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 33 2.4 Abstraction and Symbolic Representation
Consider the following picture:
It has three groups of objects. For the purposes of this book, the notation <*> means that there is a symbol between the angular brackets. I’ll use the notation <balloon> to refer to the objects in the group on the left. Sometimes, I’ll want to distinguish a verbal symbol (I hear it) from an exographics symbol (I see it). In the case where I say the word balloon, I’ll use <balloon>v and when I write it, I’ll use <balloon>e.
So what are symbols? They are purely arbitrary utterances or notations for the object we wish to refer to or represent. There is nothing about <balloon>v or <balloon>e that give any indication of the thing these symbols are referring to. They just happen to be the symbols we’ve agreed on.
The second thing worth noting is that, over a life of experience, each of us has built up a significant common inventory of these symbols and they allow us to share our ideas a skill very important for collaboration.
Children are incredibly flexible in their use of symbols. For instance, a child might hold a small length of block so that one end is over his ear and the other is at his mouth. When he then speaks into the one end of the block close to his mouth, he is thinking of the block as a telephone. Maybe two minutes later, the boy will hold the block in his hand with it stretched above his head and then run around the room making a sound as though the block is an air- plane. One minute the block is a telephone; the next it’s an airplane. The block is symbolic. But it’s a different kind of symbolic. When this same child speaks the words of his native language, he is using symbols that his society has agreed on. At play, children are inventing their own symbols for referents. This is where we excel as a species. We’re really good with symbols.

34 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas
There is some evidence that we’ve had this symbolization skill for a while. Recently, researchers discovered a 44,000-year-old cave painting on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.10 In one of the paintings, there is a figure that appears to be a man with a beak and a tail. While it’s hard to know for sure what was going on in this ancient artist’s mind, this appears to be a case where the artist has substituted animal parts for their human counterparts. This is cer- tainly evidence of symbolic thinking. No doubt the artist had a model of a man and a model of a bird, each with all its component parts. The artist then imagined combining these two models to come up with the man/animal hybrid in the painting. It’s an approach artists have used for some time. For example, the ancient Greeks invented minotaurs, sirens, satyrs, and many other composite human/animal forms.
Let’s now come back to the group of three balloons. We can speak about four related objects: the symbol we speak, <balloon>v; the symbol we write, <balloon>e; the referent, the actual ontological object in the real world that we’re referring to with our symbols; and the concept (or meaning) of <balloon> we store in our minds. This stored concept will include a lot of information and knowledge of balloons that we’ve accumulated over time.
Even though we think of this group as three balloons, there is a sense in which they are different. Each projects a different wavelength of reflected light and we use the symbol <colour> to refer to this characteristic. There is a red balloon, a blue, and a gold. Colour is not like a cat or car because it doesn’t exist by itself in the real world. You can’t reach out and touch colour. In this case, it exists as a characteristic of a balloon. We refer to such concepts that have no concrete referent as an abstract concept.
Let’s now look at all three groups in the picture. Even though these groups are of differ- ent objects (balloons, penguins, and cars), there is a sense in which each group is the same. If we count the number of objects in each group, we get the same number: three. Again, we can’t reach out and touch numberness, or, in this case, threeness. Hence, numberness and threeness are abstractions. But we can reify the concept “threeness” with these symbols: <3>e, <three>v, <three>e, and <III>e.
Let’s step back and think about the invention of language. About 3–4 million years ago, our ancestors were a small-headed ape, Australopithecus, and it’s clear from their skeletal remains, that they could not have had a voice box and the related parts that enable a modern human to speak. But at some point, between then and now, an ancestor species started to speak. Recall at the end of the first chapter that I suggested our most important cognitive skill was mind-sharing and collaboration. If there was a way to get to this wonderful idea of speech, we were the ape to do it. At the heart of speech is our ability to symbolize, to associate meaning with arbitrary physical movements (i.e., ges- ture) and/or sounds.
If speech wasn’t amazing enough, we then invented exographics about 5,000 years ago. Initially, these were short pictorial inscriptions of economic transactions. Over time, they
10 Maxime Aubert, Rustan Lebe, Agus Oktaviana, et al., “Earliest Hunting Scene in Prehistoric Art,” Nature 576 (2019): 442–445.
 
bloomed into a full-blown representation of language. Again, by inscribing symbols on a medium, we’re able to communicate a meaning to a reader. The symbol <apple>e has a well understood meaning.
As it turns out, much of our lexicon is abstract. <justice> is abstract and, by definition, does not have a corresponding physical reality. How, then, would our ancestors who invented the word have come to a shared understanding of it? It had to have been that they discussed its meaning with words which had been previously defined, some of which could have been the representations of abstract ideas.
Let’s make the example a little more understandable. How would we have come to the representation <three>? <three> is an abstract concept. As I explained above, there is no real- world referent for this concept. It’s a derivative concept in the sense that it’s a characteristic of a group of objects. As I’ll detail later in the book, it took us a long time to get to a stand-alone number three. There were a number of stages we went through before one of our ancestors realized that <three> could be a stand-alone idea. It was only after we invented exographics that we realized this. In short, abstract ideas and their symbolic representations are difficult to discover. Thankfully, language and exographics extend our capability by enabling us to invent concepts and express ideas for which there is no corresponding physical reality.
A good example of what I mean comes from the work of Andrew Wiles who managed to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, a problem in mathematics that had been open since Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665 CE) conjectured the theorem some 350 years ago. Wiles’s accomplish- ment is considered one of the great contributions to 20th-century mathematics. The proof itself is over 100 pages of dense mathematics. Here is his statement of Proposition 1:
Proposition 1. Suppose that 𝒪 is a complete discrete valuation ring
and that φ : S → T is a surjective local 𝒪-algebra homomorphism between com-
plete local Noetherian 𝒪-algebras. Suupose further that 𝔭T is a prime ideal of
T such that T/𝔭 →~ 𝒪 and let 𝔭 5φ21(𝔭 ). Assume that TST
(i) T~–𝒪[[x1,...,xr]]/(f1,...,fr−u) where r is the size of a minimal set of 𝒪-generators of 𝔭 /𝔭2 ,
TT
(ii) φ induces an isomorphism 𝔭 /𝔭2 →~ 𝔭 /𝔭2 and that these are finitely
SSTT generated 𝒪-modules whose free part has rank u.
Then d is an isomophism.11
Mathematics has come a long way since we were able to separate the idea of a stand-alone number from the object that was being counted. In Wiles’s proposition statement, there are a great number of abstract concepts, some of which would take a long time to explain even to students with a high level of training in mathematics.
I am going to reserve the special term reification for the process of bringing an abstract idea to our visual field with exographics. For example, we can reify the idea of three using the symbol <3>e. More importantly, <3>e is just as concrete as an apple or a bear.

36 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas
Here is the important point about reification: we bring whatever abstract concept we are reifying into our visual field and it is in this field that it’s persistent and amenable to manipulation. Hence, with reification, we’re able to discover that 876 × 96 is 84,096. Reifica- tion enabled Einstein to discover Special Relativity, Newton the laws of universal gravitation, and Darwin, the idea of evolution by natural selection.
2.5 The Saxe Principle of Exographic System
Change
The anthropologist Geoffrey Saxe has suggested a mechanism for how representations evolve over time:
Saxe Principle. The collective system of representations emerges over time as the unintended consequences of local goal-directed actions of individuals.12
By “collective system of representations” he means the representations that a particular culture arrives at and with “the unintended consequence of local goal-directed actions of individuals” he suggests that the underlying mechanism has an evolutionary flavour where an “environment” influences the optimizing choices of individuals. But there is a key difference. Whereas the biology of natural selection and the environment constitute the so-called blind watch-maker,13 the underpinnings of symbolic change—individual goal-seeking behavior within a given environment—is a process where the watch-maker has some limited vision.
Denise Schmandt-Besserat and others (more on this later) have suggested that the ancient Sumerians represented one unit of a particular good with a small token having a particular shape:
For instance, small and large units of grain were counted with cones and spheres, oil with ovoids, animals with cylinders and the units of labor with tetrahedrons. Perhaps the single most archaic feature of the token system was to be used in one- to-one correspondence. Two jars of oil were shown by two ovoids and three jars of oil were marked by three ovoid tokens.14
So, initially, 23 units of labour would have been represented by 23 tetrahedrons. Some cen- turies later, the ancient Babylonians represented the number 23 by making the following inscription on clay:

14 Denise Schmandt-Besserat, “Tokens and Writing: the Cognitive Development,” Scripta 1 (September 2009): 147.
  
Left to right, the first two symbols represent 10s and these are followed by three 1s. That’s certainly more efficient that fashioning 23 ovoid tokens. Centuries later we would arrive at a place-holder system and the symbol “23.”
2.6 Extending Biological Memory with
Exographics
Let’s consider the arithmetic problem again. Imagine that you have to get the product 864 × 86
and that you have been momentarily deprived of writing, calculators, computers, and any other such device that would help you get the product. What this means is that you have to get it with your unaided mind.
Let me explain how I did this problem. I envisioned the problem this way:
864 ×86
££££ ££££
£££££
This is the standard approach to getting a product that I learned in primary school. My task was to fill in the boxes. The only thing allowed in my visual field were the numbers to be multiplied: 864 × 86.
While there are now more complicated models, a simple model of our memory is that we have a Working Memory (WM) and a Long-Term Memory (LTM).15 Our WM is where we think and reason. For example, suppose I was given the problem 43 × 7. I could do this in my WM by first retrieving 7 × 3 = 21 from my LTM. Then in my working memory, I would set aside the 1 as the last digit in the answer and carry the 2. Then I would get 7 × 4 = 28, again from my LTM, and then add the carried 2 to get 30. I would conclude the answer is 301. There are other ways to do this product (i.e., (40 × 7) + (3 × 7) = 301), but save for a few LTM calls, most of us could do the computation in our WMs easily. There is no need for exographics.
Returning to the calculation of 864 × 86, I began by getting 864 × 6 = 5,184, the third row (the highest row of boxes). Then I went through the calculation of 864 × 8 to get the fourth row, 6,048. But when I got the fourth row, I had forgotten the third row. So I redid the third row, only to forget the fourth! I then decided to commit both intermediate products, 864 × 6 = 5,184 and 864 × 9 = 6,048, to my LTM. This took a lot of rehearsal. Eventually I decided
15 For more information on the structure of WM, readers are referred to Alan Baddeley’s compendium Working Memory, Thought, and Action (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007).
Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 37
   
38 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas
to “chunk” them. For example, for 864 × 6 = 5,184, I associated the names “Butkus/Moss.” These are NFL players: Dick Butkus wore the number 51 and Randy Moss wore 84. For the second, I considered that 6,048 was two chunks, 60 and 48. The first is the number of min- utes in an hour and the second is the number of hours in 2 days. This chunking enabled me to do the addition of the third and fourth rows in my WM by making a series of LTM calls to where I had stored the 51/84 and 60/48 chunks to get the digits I had to add for each column. Keep in mind that while I was doing these single digit additions, I had to also keep track of the final answer as I assembled it. The complete calculation took me about 40 minutes and most of this time was taken up with committing the third and fourth rows to my LTM. I didn’t get the correct answer because I forgot to add a carry as I was assembling the final number.
So right away we see the problem: my WM is not very big and my LTM is hard to write. This point about WM capacity goes back to the seminal work of George Miller.16 But the small capacity of WM would not be an issue if LTM were easy to write. Hence, it’s the com- bination of the two which doesn’t allow me to do the calculation quickly internally.
The problem is certainly not solved by the availability of language. If someone said to me “To get the final answer, you have to add five thousand one hundred and eight-four to six thousand forty-eight,” I’d forget the numbers before the speaker got to the end of the sen- tence. Our aural medium is not much help.
But when I am able to use exographics, I can record the third and fourth lines on paper and therefore bypass the requirement of having to put these into my LTM. It enables me to do the final column additions in my WM recording the answer digit by digit on paper as I move from the column on the right to the final column on the left. I’m effectively extending my biological WM with exographics. Keep in mind that exographics aren’t cheap. We all spend most of our childhood and teenage education years steeped in an exographics education system.
For me to do this arithmetic in my head required a lot of focus, no distractions, and men- tal energy. If I had to do this sort of thinking all day, I’d be exhausted. Hence, for a given level of mental energy, exographics extends the volume of work we can do.
Let’s now think about a 3-digit by 3-digit multiplication. These are very hard for me to do in my head, but over the years, I’ve had students who are able to do them quickly, sometimes in a matter of a few minutes. When I ask them, they tell me they do the problem the same way I do—they envision the same algorithm. Obviously, they have much larger WMs than I do. But even these students have limits. If I give them a big enough problem, they can’t do it.17
It’s worth noting that there are special individuals—mnemonists—with LTMs that are easy to write. Alexander Luria, in his book The Mind of the Mnemonist, describes the

17 There are savants who are capable of prodigious feats of calculation. In a 1907 paper, Frank Mitchell describes the ability of Zerah Colburn, an 8-year old American boy. He was able to get the 16th power of 8 (= 281,474,976,710,656) in front of an audience in London. See Frank Mitchell, “Mathematical Prodigies,” The American Journal of Psychology 18, no. 1, (Jan., 1907): 65.
 
remarkable mind of Mr. S. (or just S.).18 Whether S. heard or read information, there seemed to be no limit to what he could recall. Lists of 70 random syllables could be recalled perfectly 15 years later. Moreover, this did not appear to affect his abstract reasoning ability appre- ciably and, in some cases, he was able to solve simple problems very quickly. S. is the rare case where there does not appear to be a distinction between his WM and LTM. Effectively, he wrote his LTM with only the perceptual effort required to read or hear what was to be remembered.
This arithmetic example demonstrates that I can’t discover certain kinds of ideas with- out exographics. Of course, this begs the question of what other kinds of ideas are not discoverable.
2.7 The Nature of Arguments
At universities, scholars make arguments to justify the positions they take. Whether it’s in economics, sociology, mathematics, or any other discipline, the scholar will make a claim and then try to justify/prove the claim. For example, in his great book On the Origin of Species, Darwin argued evolution by natural selection. It’s a long argument, about 502 pages.
I am not interested in the detailed logic of arguments. I only need their generic structure. There are two types of logical arguments: inductive and deductive. The two require much different approaches. But even so, the “look” of both is similar because each comprises a set of statements. If you look at On the Origin of Species, it’s a series of statements (English sentences) from start to end. There are only a few diagrams and these serve to explicate some of the statements he makes.
Let’s look at some other arguments. Here’s a very small part of Aristotle’s Organon taken from “Prior Analytics”:
First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. If no B is A, neither can any A be B. For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B. But if every B is A then some A is B. For if no A were B, then no B could be A. But we assumed that every B is A. Similarly too, if the premiss is particular. For if some B is A, then some of the As must be B. For if none were, then no B would be A. But if some B is not A, there is no necessity that some of the As should not be B; e.g. let B stand for animal and A for man. Not every animal is a man; but every man is an animal.
First note that it’s a sequence of statements. To make this clear, I’ll list the first three: Statement 1: First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B.
Statement 2: If no B is A, neither can any A be B.
18 Alexander Luria, The Mind of the Mnemonist (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987).
Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 39
 
40 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas
Statement 3: For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A;
for C is a B.
Second, the statements are logically related. For instance, the meaning of Statement 2 is uncertain unless we’ve read Statement 1. Statement 3’s meaning is unclear unless we’ve read Statements 1 and 2, and so on.
Keep in mind that the sampling above is only a small part of the Organon. There are thousands of statements which precede it and follow it. But the structure is clear. The Orga- non constitutes an exographic idea defined to be a sequence of logically connected exo- graphic statements.
Another example is Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published in 1776. Here is the first paragraph:
In the second century of the Christian Era, the empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilized portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valor. The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines. It is the design of this, and of the two succeeding chapters, to describe the prosperous condition of their empire and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by the nations of the earth.
It is not until Chapter 38 that Gibbon gets to his thesis, that Rome crumbled from within:
The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 41 The complete six-volume argument is a sequence of statements with a logical thread connect-
ing them into a whole.
The General Structure of Arguments
Let’s represent this structure with [S1, S2, . . ., Sn, C] where S1, S2, . . ., Sn is an ordered sequence of statements and C is the claim. The statements are related since, taken in sequence, they lead to the logical conclusion C. To keep it simple, in order to produce some statements in the argument, we will need to appeal to the information in one or more prior statements. In the absence of exographics, it would be necessary to keep this prior information in WM. Clearly, as the argument gets more complex, and we have to keep more and more of this information in WM, we soon run into problem, much as I did trying to get an answer to the arithmetic problem above.
Most ideas have a local independence property. What this means is that a thinker can focus on a small part of the idea pretty much to the exclusion of all other parts of the idea. For example, consider the argument justifying the solution of an equation in mathematics:
3x – 6 = 9.
My first step would be to add 6 to both sides of the equation:
3x = 15.
At this point, I can divide both sides by 3 to get the solution
x = 5.
Note that, when I am doing the manipulation to get to the third equation, I only have to consider the second equation, 3x = 15. I don’t have to go back to the first equation. This is because the second equation is equivalent to the first in the sense that the same value of x will solve both equations. In this way, I can focus on a small part of the problem and there is no need to worry about other statements in the derivation. This independence lessens the cognitive requirement on memory but does not eliminate it.
Here is another example. Suppose we needed to sum the first 10 integers. The argument has the following structure:
S1: 1 + 2 = 3 S2: 3 + 3 = 6 S3: 6 + 4 = 10 S4: 10 + 5 = 15 S5: 15 + 6 = 21 S6: 21 + 7 = 28 S7: 28 + 8 = 36 S8: 36 + 9 = 45 C: 45 + 10 = 55

42 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas
Note that to complete this argument, we just have to remember the result of the previous statement and then add the next integer to it. This is an argument we can easily make in our WMs.
Full independence is not possible with some ideas. For instance, a novelist writing Chapter 10 doesn’t have to worry too much about Chapter 2 but, since there is a logical connection between the two chapters, the author cannot contradict the plot and character development of Chapter 2 in Chapter 10. I should probably have used the term “near independence” but “nearly local independence” is a mouthful. Regardless of terminology, most abstract arguments tend to have this independence property and this makes their ideation easier.
Another way to characterize this property is with the concept of bilevel control. For exam- ple, as a novelist works on the word-to-word details of the story in Chapter 10, he or she has in mind the “gist” of the story—where it has been and where it’s going. She has no memory record of exactly what’s been written in any of the previous chapters but she is aware of the story’s gist. As the novelist adds words to the story, she needs to make those words fit together (lower level control) while at the same time ensuring that those words are consistent with the gist of the story (upper level control). I refer to this upper and lower-level control as bilevel control.
An interesting case of the argument structure above comes from one of our greatest math- ematicians, Leonhard Euler (1707–1783 CE). Euler did some of his best mathematics when he was blind. If you’re blind, exographics is not much use to you directly. So how did he do it? As it turns out, he used scribes (one a son) who were themselves good mathematicians. He would dictate to them, and they would write it down and check that Euler made the calculation cor- rectly. One thing you have going for you in mathematics is that, most of the time, you only have to carry the last step in your memory. For example, if you are solving an equation, once you complete a line of simplification, there is no need to check any of the previous lines. Clearly, this is the same structure of argument as the sum of the first 10 digits argument.
The Tedium of Argument Without Exographics
It is possible to ideate some relatively complex abstract ideas without exographics. As Mil- man Parry has argued, the Homerian epics were performed orally long before they were ever written down.19 The implication is that they were composed without exographics. The Odys- sey is 12,000-plus lines and the Iliad is longer. Admittedly both epics are narratives and thus easier to memorize particularly with the oral-formulaic technique for retelling. Nonetheless, there is still some significant memory work to do.
As I’ve explained, when I’ve tried to do a 3-digit by 2-digit product, it takes me a long time. Let’s come back to the arithmetic problem, 864 × 69. To get it, I had to remember the results of the particular prior statements 864 × 6 = 5,184 and 864 × 9 = 6,048. Hence, I had to have both 5,184 and 6,048 in my WM at the same time that I was adding them. This turned
19 A summary of Parry’s work can be found in a volume edited by his son, Adam Parry, The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987).
 
out to be impossible for me and I ended up have to store both in my LTM in order to allow my limited WM to do the addition one column at a time. This arithmetic problem makes it clear that the question doesn’t have to be very complex before you bump into WM capacity.
Storing intermediate results in my LTM takes a lot of mental energy. As a result, once I finish the calculation, I’m tired. Or what about Gibbon’s difficulty in constructing his argu- ment. How could he have argued his idea (the complete set of statements in the six volumes) in his head? Obviously, he couldn’t. If there is no such thing as exographics, Gibbon’s history would not exist. Bear in mind that I am not concerned with Gibbon’s problem of communi- cating his idea. I’m just focussed on him thinking it through.
Even if you’re able to get through the tedium of thinking through a complex abstract idea without exographics, what do you do with it when you’re done? For a society to preserve whatever the knowledge happens to be, the thinker must transfer it to other LTMs and, in the absence of exographics, this has to be done orally. Think of the difficulty of Gibbon transfer- ring his argument to another mind orally!
In sum, Norman’s epigraph at the head of the chapter is appropriate: the power of the unaided mind is highly overrated.
2.8 A Digression on Darwin and Exographics
It’s difficult to overstate the profundity of Darwin’s idea. In the 19th century, in an age where Christian orthodoxy was that we were made by a Creator in his image and likeness, Dar- win offered a much different story. He suggested that all species were related (man to trees, flowers, and other animal species). Furthermore, he argued that we had built-in biological mechanisms that produced intra-species variation and only those most suited to the environ- ment they found themselves in would survive to reproduce and pass on their characteristics to the next generation. It’s a powerful idea, one that is now accepted by the vast majority of the scientific community.
Above I suggested that Darwin’s presentation of the idea in his book On the Origins of Species (or just Origins) is an argument consisting of a sequence of statements that leads to the claim of evolution by natural selection. The book is Darwin’s finished exographics of his idea. But to discover that idea, there were many years of study, thinking, and rough exograph- ics. Cambridge University Library holds the “Charles Darwin Papers” which comprises over 30,000 digitized pages spanning the period 1835–1882.20 Part I Creation of the Origin of Species covers the period 1837–1859 and includes notebooks and papers (rough exograph- ics) going back to the voyage of the Beagle. Over these notes, Darwin develops his ideas and eventually he is ready to produce Origins (finished exographics).
His notebook corpus is an astonishing volume of rough exographics and gives you some justification for my iceberg metaphor concerning the ratio of finished exographics to rough
Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 43

44 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas
exographics. The “1842 Pencil Sketch” is one of Darwin’s early attempts to summarize the idea. If you look at it closely, you will see that it is indeed rough. It is handwritten with lots of sections of text crossed out.21 It’s clear evidence of a scientist’s imagination at work, going back and forth with the page, to bring his ideas to the surface. This is clear evidence that exograph- ics played an important role in the development of perhaps the cleverest scientific idea to date.
It’s worth looking at the last paragraph of Origins:
It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less- improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.22
It’s a marvelous concluding paragraph. He begins with a description of the great variety of species of living things on a bank presumably next to a stream or brook. He then goes over the highlights of how natural selection works and then offers this summary: “from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows.” What is compelling is the next sentence: “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one.” This is a clear tip of the hat to the Creator. Darwin was a Christian and at one point at Cambridge seriously considered becoming an ordained minister. Surprisingly, he had the great fortitude to give his version of the creation story. He admits a God (“life . . . having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one”), but one consistent with his view of the scientific facts which led to evolution.

2.9 A Digression on the Cognitive Equivalence
of Certain Exographics
In some influential work, Eugene Ferguson traced the historical use of visualization and sketching in engineering and technology.23 He suggested that a technologist/engineer has a vision, a complete picture in his mind of what the gadget will look like, and then reproduces that vision on paper. I don’t think this is true for most engineers based on the fact that we have a limited size scratchpad (WM) as I’ve already argued.
But we could argue it another way. If there is a class of humans who are able to generate a complete one-time vision of something, then surely its artists, and among these, Picasso has to have been one of the best. But I don’t think he had these complete visions. Artists do studies in their preparation to do a painting. They do a number of sketches of the complete composition as well as work at various possibilities for the individual characters making up the composition. Picasso worked for a month and a half producing compositional and char- acter studies for his mural Guernica. We have a record of these studies and they reveal how his thinking changed over his time preparing to do the mural.24 To me, this is evidence that Picasso did not have a one-time complete vision. The compositional and character aspects of the painting were developed slowly over a significant period of time. More generally, impor- tant ideas tend to be crafted over a long period of time. For example, Charles Darwin worked his entire adult professional life developing his ideas about evolution.
Let’s return to our engineer sketching. How does he or she actually sketch in the face of limited WM? I see it as a dynamic process, a back and forth with the page until the engineer got to what he or she judged to be a suitable sketch.
My second point of departure with Ferguson is his ideas on scientific thinking versus verbal thinking versus nonverbal thinking. It’s clear that he thought these were different kinds of thinking. I don’t think they are. As I see it, they’re all the same. Let me explain.
When I make an argument, I use my LTM, WM, and the page in front of me to record the argument as I go. It’s a dynamic process that involves me processing in my WM employing the content of my LTM and the content of the page in front of me. Whether I decide to sketch a flywheel or write some mathematics or words, it’s all the same. It’s a meaningful translation of what I want to extract from my LTM and WM at the time. I then observe the new whole on the page (the “message”) and decide how to adjust it. The point is that an exographic is an exographic. So, if I’m thinking through the design of a mechanical gadget, then I’ll make a series of sketches. If I’m trying to figure out the mechanical advantage of a pulley system, I’ll use a diagram and some mathematics. If I’m writing a novel, I’ll use words. The type of objects I choose to put on a page will

46 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas
depend on the problem I’m trying to solve. In his studies for Guernica, Picasso didn’t use words to plan the bull in the top left-hand corner. He sketched it. All of what we put on the page is cognitively the same—it’s the symbols we think we need to push the idea forward.
When one of my students is unsatisfied with the way a question was marked on an exam, he or she will discuss the grade with me. Most of the time, students want more credit for a highly disorganized answer. When they are uncertain about the answer at the time of the exam’s writing, they’ll do a memory dump of all the points they think might be relevant, usu- ally at random locations on the page. Then they’ll point to one or two pieces of this dump in the post-exam discussion with me once they know what the correct answer is, often saying “But, sir, you know what I meant!” It’s their view that the argument was clear in their heads but they had difficulty putting it on paper. My experience is quite different. As I bring an idea to the surface, the thoughts in my head are quite muddled. I have to use the page to clarify my thinking. In fact, the clearest version is always on the page and not in my mind. Given my limited WM, there is no way I could have a clearer argument in my mind. Needless to say, this line of student appeal no longer works with me.
2.10 The Ideasphere and Its Partition
Millions of years ago, our ancestor species were knapping stone to make tools, and, as time passed, they made more sophisticated tools. Since that time, we’ve learned how to control fire, how to cook, we invented agriculture and its associated tools and implements, learned metallurgy and how to fashion metal tools and especially weapons, we invented yarn and textiles, and made clothes. We’ve done some impressive ideation and none of it required writing.
In the context of ideating an artifact, at all steps in the innovation process, the incomplete gadget is persistent in the innovator’s field of view and with eyesight, hands, and imagina- tion, the finished gadget eventually comes to life. We’ve had a long history of working with objects in our visual frame. It’s clear that the imaginations of our ancient ancestors were able to make the connection between their actions to reshape a rock and what that altered rock could do for them when it came to butchering a carcass.
Coming back to the idea of reification, I argued that exographics give us a way of bring- ing abstract concepts into our visual field where we have a long experience of manipulat- ing objects. Working on ideas with exographics requires the same process as with visible objects except that the things we work on with our hands are exographics on a page. These exographics on the page are no less real than the materials and tools we use to build concrete gadgets.
So some ideas require exographics to discover and others don’t. Let’s now explore why.
I’ve chosen the idea as my fundamental unit of analysis. The word “idea” comes from the Greek work “ɩ’δɛˈα” which means “form” or “pattern” and the Greek verb “ɩ’δɛı̃ν” which

means “to see.” Ideas and vision seem to go hand in hand. We have a long history of using our imaginations and hands to manipulate objects in our visual field. It’s a familiar and very comfortable medium for human ideation.
Ideas are intimately related to culture. One of the characteristics of our species is that we’re extraordinarily good at culture. One way to define culture is with our lifeways (beliefs, customs, knowledge, ideas, behaviors, institutions, laws, dress, architecture, art, etc.) But each of these cultural objects begins with an idea. We first have to imagine a cultural object; and then we take action to attempt to make it a cultural object.
Hence, we could think of our accumulated culture as equivalent to a set of ideas. And let’s think broadly about this set. Let’s consider all world cultures and all the ideas that have given rise to those cultures. It includes the Moonblood creation myth of the Yanomami (a people who inhabit the Amazon rainforest), Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selec- tion, bicycles, pastrami, and baseball. As I suggested in Chapter 1, I’ll refer to the complete set of ideas as the Ideasphere.25
It’s worth noting that there are some remarkably good books on ideas. One is Daniel Boorstin’s The Discoverers; another is Ideas by Peter Watson.26 Still another good source is A History of Technology by Trevor Singer et al.27
There is a dependence structure within the Ideasphere. Some ideas require that we solve a number of other problems first and these solutions are also ideas. For example, let’s con- sider our idea of going to the moon and a related idea. On the return trip to earth, there is the small problem of entering the earth’s atmosphere at high speed. Just as meteors burn up, the Apollo 11 Command Module (CM) would have had it not been for its heat shield. The re-entry speed of the CM was about 17,500 miles per hour or about 5 miles per second. Most of us have experienced the force of the air when you put your arm out the window of a mov- ing car. Imagine what that force would be at a speed of 5 miles per second. Apparently, it’s enough to raise the underside of the CM to about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The process to put the heat shield in place was complicated.28 One of the critical parts was to inject each of 370,000 honeycomb shaped cylinders with a special compound. For this task, technologists called gunners used a special injection machine. The inspection and quality control process to make sure every cell was filled properly was extensive. All in, the number of problems that needed to be solved to put this part of the heat shield in place was enormous. For example,
25 The inspiration for the Ideasphere comes from the anthropologist Wade Davis and his conception of the Ethnosphere which he defines to be “the sum total of all the [human] thoughts, dreams, ideals, myths, intuitions, and inspirations brought into being by the imagination since the dawn of consciousness.” See his paper “Keynote Speech: The Ethnosphere and the Academy,” available at: https://www.wheretherebedragons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ DavisEthnosphereAcademy.pdf.

what properties did the material injected into the honeycombs have to have? Why the hon- eycomb design? And why 370,000 honeycombs? The list is endless. That’s just for the heat shield! Going to the moon was an idea that required us to have a significant number of addi- tional ideas. The point is that there is a dependence structure within the Ideasphere, one I will make clear in Chapter 4.
To add to the Ideasphere, we allow our imaginations to contemplate our experience and knowledge. As the examples above illustrate, sometimes we have to use exographics to help our imaginations access those ideas. While we need exographics to access certain kinds of ideas, we certainly didn’t need it to invent candles, coffee, and cities. This leads naturally to a partition of the Ideasphere into those ideas that require exographics to discover (the A Class, where the A stands for “Abstract”) and those that don’t (the C Class where C is for “Concrete”). I will also refer to the A Class as simply “The Abstract.”
As I will argue in the next two chapters, the A Class is a vast expanse of ideas which has tended to grow exponentially over the last five centuries. It includes all of the knowledge we’ve generated at universities in the various disciplines and also a substantial proportion of our material culture including computers, smart-phones, cars, and aircraft.
2.11 Catching Unicorns
Let’s summarize.
We’ve evolved two remarkable intelligences. One is a powerful imagination, one that
enables us to think about alternative futures and then, with our hands, try to make one of them happen. The other intelligence is our collaborative intelligence. We now depend on one another almost completely.
Not surprisingly these intelligences resulted in the cultural artifact of language, and more recently, we’ve developed an exographic skill. Both language and exographics rely on our remarkable symbolic ability, this skill we have to associate an idea with sound (language) and/or drawings (exographics). With our collaborative skill, we’ve managed to agree on and share an astonishing symbol set and ways of stringing these symbols into ideas.
More particularly, we’ve been able to imagine concepts/ideas that don’t exist in the real world. Not only that, we’re able to bring those abstract concepts/ideas into the concrete real-world with our exographics skill. As we have seen, this exographic skill enables us to extend our WMs to hatch some very complex ideas. This, then, is one of the great values of exographing it allows us to take full advantage of our imaginations and discover ideas that we otherwise couldn’t. It’s why I’ve titled the book as I have: exographics gives us a way of capturing the unicorns our minds can produce.
