I believe it’s made all the difference and I hope to convince you of that in this book. We sometimes think of writing as the representation of speech. But it’s more than that. For example, we now use writing to generate the staff notation of modern music, the symbols of mathematics, and the language of computer coding. I’ll refer to the complete set of these inscribed symbols and representations as exographics. I’ll refer to the act of inscribing them on the medium as exographing. “Exographing” means “writing” but includes more than just the representation of speech. So why is exographing important? We’ve known for some time that it plays an important role in our ability to discover certain kinds of ideas. While we’ve needed it to discover the Theory of Relativity, develop smartphones, and design computer chips, we certainly didn’t need it to innovate clothing, the back-beat, and the Nike advertising slogan “Just do it.” Consequently, my purpose is to identify precisely how exographing helps us to discover certain kinds of ideas and then explore the nature of the resulting set of ideas. We’re going to see that this set is extraordinarily large, that it’s growing at an exponential rate, and that it gives rise to our advanced techno-literate societies. I’ll claim and then justify that without exographing, we’d be living as modern oral societies do, and that is a much simpler existence lacking many of the material artifacts we currently enjoy. If you google “writing is thinking,” you’ll get 5.1 billion hits. At many of these sites, the eminent historian David McCullough’s meme is cited: “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly.” Here is the view of the eminent French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss: Writing is a strange thing. It would seem as if its appearance could not have failed to wreak profound changes in the living conditions of our race, and that the transformations must have been above all intellectual in character. Yet nothing 3 4 Chapter 1 Preliminaries of what we know of writing, or of its role in evolution, can be said to justify the conception.1 Effectively he is suggesting that writing has made a difference but that nobody had yet offered a reasonable explanation why. In this book, I intend to explain why. I think it’s fair to say that most of us understand there is a relationship between writing and thinking, that writing helps us to think. But if I asked you how writing helps, you probably wouldn’t be able to say much. In fact, you might even argue that you don’t care how it works. You just know that it works. To be frank, that’s what my response would have been fifteen years ago. But as a result of a fortuitous observation, I got interested in the topic. As I hope to show, there is a lot we can say. 1.1 Literacy in the Wild This book is going to focus on our use of literacy to think. But there are many more uses of literacy in our everyday life. Since we’re so enmeshed in it, it’s difficult to appreciate just how much we depend on it. In the face of this gap, I thought I’d track my use of it for a few hours of a pretty standard morning. My description of these hours follows and, in it, I’ve embed- ded some numbers. For each number, I’ll give a more complete explanation of the particular literacy the number refers to after the description. Today I woke up and wondered if it was time to get up so I checked my Fitbit which gives a digital time. It read 5:45 so I got up and did a few chores including taking my blood pressure (1). The reading from my machine is the standard two numbers, in my case 135 and 81, in addition to a graphic which tells me whether the reading is good (green), not great (yellow), or bad (red) (2). I then settled into my easy chair to look at my overnight email. One email required a slight redraft of a paper and then sending it back to my co-author (3). Then I went to the NY Times website and read for about an hour (4). After I finished reading, I decided to work on editing a manuscript (this one) and spent about an hour rewriting part of a chapter (5). When the time on my computer got to 8:15, I wrapped up my editing and began to get ready to go to a medical appointment at the hospital (6). The appointment was for 9 am. So I got ready, hopped in my vehicle, and headed to the hospital. Once near the hospital, I decided to park on one of the main streets. I found a spot, pulled in, and then went to the machine to get a parking ticket. I looked at the directions on this machine (I don’t use them often) to see what to do (7). When I tried to insert my coin, the machine was jammed. So I went back to my vehicle, took a blank piece 1 Claude Lévi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques (New York: Atheneum, 1961), 291. of paper from my small notepad and left a note for parking enforcement on my dashboard. I put the date and time on the note and explained that the coin slot was jammed (8). Once inside the hospital, I pulled out the note I had made on how to get where I was to go: “Go to the 3rd floor, make a right, and go to Home Cardiographics.” (9) I went to the elevators and once inside one of them, I hit the button for the third floor (10). Once at the third floor, I made the right turn and walked down the hallway checking all of the signs as I ran into them. There were some overhead signs but most were on the doors. I had to check a number of these before I finally found my destination (11). Upon arrival, an attendant asked to see my medical card. Then she got out a form to do the COVID screening with me. She had clearly done this a lot so didn’t need many reminders from the form which listed the questions. But she did need a few (12). I was then instructed to go to the waiting room until they were ready to take me. Another attendant came to get me and took me to the room where someone was going to install the heart monitor I was to wear. She pulled out a sheaf of forms and began by asking me my birthdate. When I responded correctly, she proceeded to install a heart monitor on me explaining how I would do it over the two weeks. I was required to wear it 24/7 taking it off only to bathe. She also gave me written instructions and a graphic for the correct placement of the black, brown, and grey electrodes. The whole procedure took about five minutes and I then departed (13). When I got to the door, I had forgotten which way to turn. She saw me pause and then said immediately “Right and go the end of the hall.” (14) When I got in the hallway, I looked in the direction she told me and saw the standard red “Elevator” sign at the end of the hall close to the ceiling. I knew the elevators would be close at that point (15). Explanations 1. Life Management: I have to be literate to read my Fitbit and being able to tell the time enables me to organize my day. 2. Life Management: With Fitbits, blood pressure measurement devices, and other self- measurement tools, we’re better able to manage our individual health. But to do this, we have to be literate. I have to be able to read and understand the digital and graphi- cal measurements these devices produce. 3. Ideation and Recording: I’d been engaging with a colleague on a paper and he had suggested an edit, one that I would have to word. I thought his suggestion was good so massaged the paper until I was happy with it. It took me about three tries until I thought my words captured what my colleague suggested. Getting the words cor- rectly on paper for me is a matter of drafting and redrafting until I think I’ve captured the idea. What is clear is that I’m thinking and hence this is the ideation purpose Chapter 1 Preliminaries 5 6 Chapter 1 Preliminaries of writing. Additionally, there is a recording purpose. Once I have the right words, they’re in a file and captured. When I was happy with the redrafting, I sent the file back to my co-author as an attachment to a short email. 4. Life Management: For me, reading the NY Times is essential. It tells me what is going on in the world, how various op-ed writers feel about world events, and other useful reading including articles and columns in the Books Section and sometimes, the Science Section. This morning, Dennis Overbye, in his column “Out There,” reported that an announcement was forthcoming on the nature of the black hole, Sagittarius A*, at the center of our galaxy. 5. Ideation and Recording: I need to think to edit a manuscript. I’m continually look- ing for ways to write to make my ideas clearer. It’s a back and forth with the page. I try something and if I like it, I move on. Otherwise, I try to rewrite. 6. Life Management: As I was doing my editing, I was keeping my eye on the clock on my computer. I felt that leaving the computer at 8:15 would give me time to get cleaned up and get to the hospital. 7. Life Management: The written directions on the front of the meter reminded me of how it worked. 8. Life Management: I wrote the note and put in on the driver’s side dash so the parking attendant could see and read it. I was hoping that this might avert a ticket. I could have used a machine a block away but, as it was, I was late for my appointment. 9. Life Management/Aide Memoire: When I arranged the appointment over the phone, the administrator gave me directions to get to Home Cardiographics and I wrote these out in a notebook. The night before, I transcribed the directions to a smaller piece of paper that I put in my pocket. I term this an Aide Memoire and it’s a lot like the gro- cery list my wife gives me when I go out shopping for her. It’s a way of remembering if my memory fails me. 10. Life Management: I have to be able to recognize the written number 3 in order to get to the right floor. 11. Life Management: Once I got to the third floor, I had to navigate to the right office and I did this by reading the signs on the doors and on the walls. 12. Life Management: The attendant had to have literacy skills to take information from my health insurance card, and to administer the COVID screening questions to me (the list of questions was an Aide Memoire for her). 13. Life Management: The attendant who installed the heart monitor and instructed me on what I had to do definitely needed literacy skills and I had to take the written instructions with me. For me, these were an Aide Memoire in case I forgot how to do it at some point over the two-week period. 14. This point has nothing to do with literacy skills but it’s important. The moment I appeared uncertain as to which way to go when I got outside the door, the nurse anticipated that I would likely ask for directions and so gave them to me without me asking. It saved her some time and probably saved me a lot of time. As we will see later in the book, we are remarkable collaborators and this skill of the attendant’s— understanding exactly what was going on in my mind—is a skill that cognitive scien- tists have termed theory of mind. 15. Life Management: I am familiar with common navigation signs and certainly a red “Elevator” sign is a common navigational sign in large buildings where there are lots of visitors (explorers). What this description makes clear is that literacy plays a big role in our cognitive life. To function as an adult in our advanced techno-literate societies, we need to be literate. Acquiring this skill is not cheap. We spend a lot of our early life in school and it’s here where we learn the literacy skills to function in our society. This description also makes clear that we use writing to think. Several of my entries are marked “Ideation” and it’s here where I am using my literacy skills to help me think. That’s what this book is about. I’m going to explain how we use literacy to support our imaginations when we use them to ideate. 1.2 How Writing Helps Us Think I’ll begin by explaining my fortuitous observation. As I recall, I was sitting in my office working through a solution to an assignment I’d given my students. At one point I had to get the product 87.6 × 9.6. At that time, I normally used a spreadsheet for such arithmetic. But to do so would have required me to get up from my desk and walk over to the computer. I decided to work it out on the side of the sheet of paper I was working on. I soon had the answer: 87.6 × 9.6 = 840.96. Then it hit me. I realized that I couldn’t do this calculation in my head. If I just sat there, stared into space, and tried to get that product, I couldn’t do it. I could do simple products like 8 × 9 easily enough but not the more complex problem. The following weekend, I got up early on the Saturday morning when the house was quiet, parked myself in my easy chair, and tried to get 876 × 96 by just sitting and thinking it through.2 In Chapter 2, I’ll explain more about this experiment, but suffice it to say here that I almost got the right answer, and it took me about forty minutes. Most of us can do this problem with pencil and paper, but it’s much more difficult (impossible?) with our unassisted minds. I then started to think about why. Even though 876 × 96 = 84,096 is child’s play for most of us, it’s a very sophisticated idea that we didn’t come to overnight. Much of it, including the placeholder system of number representation and the arithmetic operations like multiplication, goes back about 4,000 years to the work of Babylonian scribes. More recently, we’ve been working on algorithms to do 2 Rather than look at the shortcut 876 × 96 = 876 × (100 − 4) = 87,600 − 876 × 4, I stayed with brute force on 876 × 96. Chapter 1 Preliminaries 7 8 Chapter 1 Preliminaries these products as efficiently as possible on machines. To date, David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven have discovered the most efficient method.3 For large integers, it works in a small fraction of the time required by the method we learned in primary school. But, for the moment, let’s consider 876 × 96 = 84,096 to be an idea. Forget about the 4,000 years of work to get to 876 × 96. Let’s just focus on starting with the product, 876 × 96, and then working to the idea, 876 × 96 = 84,096. To get it, we can execute the recipe we learned in primary school. As it turns out, this recipe is equivalent to a sequence of statements: 6 × 6 = 36 / record 6 and carry 3 6 × 7 + 3 = 45 / record 56 and carry 4 : 78,840 + 5,256 = 84,096. The difficulty in executing these statements using only my unaided mind is that in order to do the last line (78,840 + 5,256 = 84,096), I have to remember the intermediate products, 78,840 and 5,256. These come from previous statements and I found I had trouble remembering them. If the numbers were just a little bit bigger to begin with, it would be impossible. So for me, the idea 876 × 96 = 84,096 is only discoverable with pen and paper. It’s not much of a stretch to suggest that the arguments to get to other ideas have a simi- lar structure. An argument is a logical sequence of statements that gets to an idea. Charles Darwin’s argument in The Origin of Species is simply a sequence of statements and this sequence eventually arrives at the idea of evolution by natural selection. Actually, we’re interested in how Darwin got to this argument before ever sitting down to write it out and I’ll address that issue in Chapter 2. We’ll never know exactly how this occurred but we do know that he worked for decades before eventually writing The Origin of Species. As you work through any argument, you’ll have to remember the results of previous statements to finish the statement you’re at, and for complex arguments like the arithmetic argument above, this is generally impossible. Hence, my observation that applies to arithmetic also applies to more general and complex ideas: I can’t discover certain ideas unless I have this technology of exographics. I can still remember the shock of that discovery. No teacher or professor had ever explained to me why I needed exographics to be able to discover certain kinds of ideas. Almost immediately I thought that maybe I had missed the lesson. But these many years later, it’s now clear to me it was never given. There is more we can say. For one, note that I have to use my hands to operate this tech- nology of pen and paper. The implication is that we need our hands to take full advantage of our imaginations. Second, we’ve developed a shared understanding of the symbols that we 3 David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven, “Integer Multiplication in Time O(n logn),” Annals of Mathematics 193, no. 2 (2021): 563–617. put on the page. When I write 78,840 + 5,256 = 84,096 on a page, you know what I mean and so does everybody else. Now let’s see what we can learn from other examples. Example 1 The arithmetic example makes a subtle point. Most people are not prepared to concede they need an external technology like exographing to help them think. For example, consider this conversation I had with my sister, a lawyer. She asked me to tell her something interesting about the research I was doing. I thought for a moment and replied, “When you do seri- ous legal thinking, you always use your hands.” She looked at me like I had five heads and responded categorically that she used her head to think. I then asked her how she prepared for an important cross-examination, knowing that she would tell me she wrote it out on a legal pad with her favourite fountain pen. When she did, I came back with “So you use your hands to think.” She looked at me, thought for a moment, and said “I might use my hands, but my mind is telling my hands what to do. My head is driving the whole process.” “OK,” I said, “but what if I took away the pad and pen? Could you put together a cross-examination?” At this point a light bulb appeared to go on and she conceded my claim, remarking that she’d never really thought about it that way. This example has two important takeaways. First, it’s another example where, without exographing, certain kinds of ideas (a lawyer’s preparation for a cross-examination) are not discoverable. Second, my sister was under the mistaken impression that her mind alone was responsible for her thinking. This belief is not uncommon and is sometimes referred to as neurocentrism. Example 2 William Stukeley, a contemporary of Isaac Newton (1642–1726 CE), related this about the great scientist’s walks on the grounds of Cambridge: . . . & when he took a turn in the fellows gardens, if some new gravel happen’d to be laid on the walks, it was sure to be drawn over, & over, with a bit of stick, in Sir Isaac’s diagrams; which the fellows would cautiously spare, by walking beside them. & there they would sometime remain for a good while.4 Apparently, Newton was not averse to drawing in the mud to explore an idea. Why couldn’t one of the greatest minds this planet has produced have just kept walking and thinking to get his answers? Could it be that exographing enabled his imagination? 4 William Stukeley, The Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton’s Life (London: The Royal Society, 1752), http://www. newtonproject. ox. ac. uk/catalogue/record/OTHE00001. The book is based on conversations Stukeley had with Humphrey Newton (no relation to Isaac Newton) and John Wickens, both friends of Newton. Wickens shared rooms with Newton at Cambridge for twenty years (1663–1683). Chapter 1 Preliminaries 9 10 Chapter 1 Preliminaries Example 3 Albert Einstein (1879–1955 CE) was famous for his visual thought experiments and these informed his greatest insights. In part, Special Relativity was born of one involving two observers, a moving train, and two bolts of lightning. But these visualizations were just the start of his work. To get to Special Relativity from this visualization, he had to sit with a pen and paper and work through the mathematics the visualization suggested. A reading of any of the Einstein biographies makes it clear that there were many occasions when he was anxious to get back to his office to see if the mathematics of a vision would bear fruit. Clearly, Ein- stein needed exographing to discover Special Relativity. Example 4 Mary Carruthers gives this account of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 CE).5 He was sitting next to King Louis XI of France at dinner one evening when he suddenly struck the table and exclaimed “That settles the Manichees!” He then called to his secretary “Reginald! Get up and write!” At the time, he was writing the Summa Theologica and it was his practice to “write” by dictating to secretaries. Aquinas’s abrupt behaviour would be unacceptable if he were dining with a friend. But with the King? It had to be that he was pretty sure he had sorted out the Manichees but, like Einstein, was desperate to check that his meditative thought made sense by writing out the argument in full. Aquinas required exographing to think through some of his ideas. Example 5 Bono, the charismatic frontman of U2, is the band’s chief lyricist. He’s been responsible for the words to some of the most iconic songs in rock history. He is also a songwriter, meaning that he composes melodies. There is not much information on exactly how he creates but I’ve been able to piece together the following picture from various sources. His approach is largely a process where he experiments and builds snippets of the song as he goes. When he gets inspiration for what could be a good lyric snippet, he writes it down on whatever is available whether it be restaurant napkins, backs of envelopes, etc. This writing is simply a reliable way to store potential lyrics. The melding of lyrics and melody is experimental, trying this and that, until he gets something to work. As this process proceeds, the lyrics are written down for later readjustment as the lyric/mel- ody creation process unfolds. For Bono, exographing is an essential part of his creative process. The Importance of Imagination Let’s take stock. These examples suggest that some of our greatest thinkers required exo- graphing to discover their ideas. I don’t want to leave the impression that exographing is the main explanation for us getting to ideas because it’s not. Exographing is important but what 5 Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 5. really makes the difference is our imaginations working on our internalized knowledge. To take full advantage of our imaginations and knowledge, we sometimes need exograph- ing. Borrowing terminology from logic, exographing is a necessary technology to be able to discover certain kinds of ideas. But it’s not sufficient. Exographing, by itself, doesn’t get you anything. But connect it to a fertile imagination and knowledge, and the three can do wonders. This brings me to the title of the book. In one version of the lore on unicorns, they’re fast, fierce, and elusive. Like unicorns, some ideas are difficult to capture. In fact, there are some ideas we can’t discover with just our naked imaginations. But we can if those imaginations are supported by exographing. 1.3 The Relevant Literature The Ghost in the Machine Cartesian duality is the idea that each of us has a mind and body and that the body is the ser- vant of the mind. It dates at least to the Greek philosopher Plato who believed that, apart from our bodies, we had an eternal spirit. René Descartes (1596–1650 CE) saw the mind as not made of matter, but in the body and able to control matter. Over time, as we discovered more about how the brain worked and was structured, we came to view the physical brain and its associated electro-chemical neuronal network as the seat of all thought. The philosopher Gilbert Ryle (1900–1976 CE) signalled the end of duality with his famous characterization of Descartes’s concept of mind as “the Ghost in the Machine.”6 Cognitive Artifacts I’ve argued that the cognitive skill of exographing is crucial for certain kinds of thinking. There are many other examples. When we are trying to figure out how to get from where we are to where we want to be, we sometimes use a map. We first locate our position on the map and then we look at our surroundings to orient these surroundings with the representation in the map. Once we do these two things, we can begin to make decisions about how to get to the place we want to be. The map, an exographic, is crucial to navigation. There are some famous examples. One is Harry Beck’s map of the London Tube System. It in no way reflects the actual distances between stops but it’s excellent for navigating the system. For thousands of years, Micronesians, without instruments, were able to sail between islands thousands of miles apart. Ben Finney describes this astounding skill in this way: The navigational practices of Oceanians present somewhat of a puzzle to the student of the history of cartography. Here were superb navigators who sailed their Chapter 1 Preliminaries 11 6 Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind (Chicago: University of Chicago Press (Kessinger Reprint), 1949), 15–16. 12 Chapter 1 Preliminaries canoes from island to island, spending days or sometimes many weeks out of sight of land, and who found their way without consulting any instruments or charts at sea. Instead, they carried in their head images of the spread of islands over the ocean and envisioned in the mind’s eye the bearings from one to the other in terms of a conceptual compass whose points were typically delineated according to the rising and setting of key stars and constellations or the directions from which named winds blow. Within this mental framework of islands and bearings, to guide their canoes to destinations lying over the horizon these navigators applied vital information obtained by watching with the naked eye the stars, ocean swells, steady winds, island-influenced cloud formations, land-nesting birds fishing out at sea, and other cues provided by nature.7 This is a remarkable achievement. Sailors used the night sky and other artifacts to navigate for days over vast distances between small islands. To cook a dish, professional chefs will prepare its ingredients ahead of time and then put them in the order they go into the pot. This saves them having to check all aspects of the written recipe as they cook.8 To teach arithmetic, a primary school teacher often has students use manipulatives. For example, to learn how to do simple subtraction problems, say 5 − 2, a child will begin with 5 counters (a uniform object like disks or chips) and then remove 2 counters to arrive at the answer, 3. Eventually the child will internalize the problem and manipulatives are no longer required. Bartenders, upon getting an order, will immediately place the various kinds of glasses required on the bar-rail. In part, these glasses serve as a mnemonic for the bartender to fill the order. This is because there are only so many kinds of drinks that you can put into, say, a Collins glass. As the drinks are mixed, the liquid in the glasses also serves as mnemonic. Inter- estingly, very experienced bartenders outgrow these mnemonics. When they get to this point, they can focus on conversations with patrons, something that leads to higher tips, on average.9 Embodied Thought In the last thirty years, we’ve come around to the view that our cognition depends upon neural processes, bodily processes, and artifacts in the environment. We have a number of terms for this including embodied thought, cognitive integration, the extended mind, mate- rial engagement theory, and cognitive offloading. All of these descriptions take the view that our thinking is sometimes enhanced by artifacts in the environment. I am going to use the 7 Ben Finney, “Nautical Cartography and Traditional Navigation in Oceania,” Chapter 13 in The History of Cartography, Volume Two, Book Three: Cartography in the Traditional African, American, Arctic, Australian, and Pacific Societies, eds. David Woodward and G. Malcolm Lewis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011), 443. 8 David Kirsh, “The Intelligent Use of Space,” Artificial Intelligence 72, no. 1–2 (1995): 31–68. 9 King Beach, “Becoming a Bartender: The Role of External Memory Cues in a Work-directed Educational Activity,” Applied Cognitive Psychology 7, no. 3 (1993): 191–204. terms embodied thought or embodied mind over the remainder of this book. At times I will refer to the contrast in beliefs about where thinking takes place. One side of the debate argues that all cognitive activity resides in our heads. This position is sometimes called neurocen- trism (or internalism). The other side, which argues that our cognition also requires bodily processes and artifacts in the environment, is termed cognitive integration and those who believe it are termed cognitive integrationists. My reading of the literature suggests that Merlin Donald was the first to think about the role of writing in the evolution of the human mind. In his 1991 book, Origins of the Modern Mind, he posited three developmental stages (episodal, mimetic, and symbolic), and in the last stage—the symbolic stage—advanced to symbolic thought (speech and writing), a change he referred to as the exographic revolution. In this book, he originated the concept of an exogram, and defined it to be “an external memory record of an idea.”10 He also suggested the term exographics as a synonym for exogram. I will have more to say about both these and particularly the contrast between the exogram and engram (defined to be the biological stor- age of a piece of information) as I develop the concept of abstract idea reification in Chapter 2. Donald is firmly in the camp of cognitive integration. Donald Norman also recognized the power of exographing in ideation and this paragraph is one that should have drawn more attention than it did: The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated. Without external aids, memory, thought, and reasoning are all constrained. But human intelligence is highly flexible and adaptive, superb at inventing procedures and objects that overcome its own limits. The real powers come from devising external aids that enhance cognitive abilities. How have we increased memory, thought, and reasoning? By the invention of external aids: It is things that make us smart. Some assistance comes through cooperative social behavior; some arises through exploitation of the information present in the environment; and some comes through the development of tools of thought—cognitive artifacts—that complement abilities and strengthen mental powers. ... Probably the most important of our external aids are paper, pencil, and the corresponding skills of reading and writing. But because we tend to notice the unique, not the commonplace, few recognize them for the powerful tools that they are, nor does the average person realize what breakthroughs in reasoning and technology were required to invent writing, numerical representations, portable and reliable pens and pencils, and inexpensive, functional writing paper.11 This paragraph is a clear statement of embodied thinking. Note that Norman also suggests that we don’t appreciate the power of exographing because it’s so endemic. He begins by noting that 10 Merlin Donald, Origins of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the Evolution of Culture and Cognition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991), 314. 11 Donald Norman, Things That Make Us Smart (New York: Basic Books, 1993), 43–44. Chapter 1 Preliminaries 13 14 Chapter 1 Preliminaries our thinking minds have some pretty serious limitations. But happily, we were smart enough to invent technologies like exographing that enabled us to overcome some of these weaknesses. Edwin Hutchins looked at distributed cognition, how individuals formed cognitive sys- tems where the individuals within such a system generally engaged in embodied cognition. In his book Cognition in the Wild, he presents a detailed study of the cognitive systems used aboard a Navy ship.12 A good modern example are the systems large ships use to berth. Such berthing requires the coordination of many individuals including those on the ship’s bridge, those in tugboats, and those who will engage the ship’s mooring system to secure the vessel to its berth. This system is distributed and many cognitive artifacts are used. As I will explain later in this development, I think Hutchins’s work was critical because it got us thinking about the importance of the embodied mind in a network of imaginations which, to me, is the signature accomplishment of our species. The title of Hutchins’s book, Cognition in the Wild, is a remarkable turn of phrase. At the time he wrote the book, symbolic computational theories of the mind were in vogue. Cogni- tive scientists saw the mind as essentially a computer that worked on symbolically coded information stored in the mind. Hutchins’s observations of the way we actually thought (i. e., cognition in the wild) suggested that there was more to the nature of our thinking processes than in-mind symbolic computation. David Kirsh asks why we have a tendency to build an external representation of some- thing we are trying to understand.13 Just as Newton drew in the mud, some of us pick up a pencil and paper to try and figure something out. For example, consider this problem drawn from the Ladies’ Journal of 1707: If to my age there added be One half, one third, and three times three; Six score and ten the sum you’ld see, Pray find out what my age may be. I would go right to pen and paper to solve this problem.14 The interesting question, Kirsh sug- gests, is “. . . why do people do more than just think in their heads?”15 David Chalmers and Andy Clark begin with this question: “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?”16 They suggest that some “accept the demarcations of skin and skull, and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind.” They disagree and argue that “cognitive processes ain’t (all) in the head!” The classic justification is a relatively com- plicated arithmetic problem like the one discussed above. Chalmers and Clark would refer to the system of the human, the pencil and paper as a “coupled system.” Clark subsequently 12 Edwin Hutchins, Cognition in the Wild (Boston: MIT Press, 1976). 13 David Kirsh, “Thinking with External Representations,” AI and Society 25, no. 4 (2010). 14 I get the answer to be 66. 15 Kirsh, “Thinking,” 441. 16 David Chalmers and Andy Clark, “The Extended Mind,” Analysis 58, no. 1 (1998): 7. presents a more complete description of his ideas in his books Supersize the Mind and Nat- ural-Born Cyborgs, and a number of other publications.17 He argues that we are cyborgs by nature and the human mind has never been “bound and restricted by the biological skin-bag . . . the ancient fortress of skin and skull.”18 Of course, his position has not been without controversy. The main objection, that I can see, is that some philosophers don’t like attribut- ing cognition to a pencil and some paper. For my work, I really don’t need to wade into this debate. I’m happy to recognize that artifacts like a pencil and paper enable us to discover ideas we otherwise couldn’t and leave it at that. There have been other important contributors. As a result of the abject early failures of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Rodney Brooks suggested that “we should build complete intel- ligent systems that we let loose in the real world with real sensing and real actions.”19 He is advocating machines whose thought is embodied. Francisco Varela, Eleanor Rosch, and Evan Thompson wrote an important early book grounding the embodied mind in human experience.20 Lambros Malafouris has proposed his version of embodied thinking: Material Engagement Theory.21 Karenleigh Overmann has done important work on the embodied thinking related to the origins of numbers.22 I will appeal to her work when I look at abstrac- tion in the next chapter. Richard Menary has offered an excellent synthesis of the implica- tions of cognitive integration for writing and thinking.23 Other important contributions are the connectionist theories of David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the PDP Research Group.24 As I remarked above, the dominant view of the working mind in the 1980s was sym- bolic computation. In contrast, Rumelhart et al. thought of the mind as having a massively parallel structure based on neural networks. As we will see, our mimicking of this structure in mathematical models has led to significant breakthroughs in deep learning, a topic I will tackle later in the book. Another useful construct for my argument is cognitive offloading as described by Evan Risko and Sam Gilbert.25 They define it to be the use of bodily action to reduce the cognitive demands of an information processing requirement. In the arithmetic problem above, I am essentially using pen and paper to expand my working memory. 17 Andy Clark, Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008); and Andy Clark, Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003). 18 Clark, Natural-Born Cyborgs, 4–5. 19 Rodney Brooks, “Intelligence Without Representation,” Artificial Intelligence 47 (1991): 139. 20 Francisco Varela, Eleanor Rosch, and Evan Thompson, The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1991). 21 Lambros Malafouris, How Things Shape the Mind: A Theory of Material Engagement (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2013). 22 Karenleigh Overmann, The Material Origins of Numbers: Insights from the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East (Pis- cataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2019). 23 Richard Menary, “Writing as Thinking,” Language Sciences 29 (2007). 24 David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the PDP Research Group, Parallel Distributed Processing, Volume 1, Explora- tions in the Microstructure of Cognition: Foundations (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1986). 25 Evan Risko and Sam Gilbert, “Cognitive Offloading,” Trends in Cognitive Science 20, no. 9 (2016): 676–688. Chapter 1 Preliminaries 15 16 Chapter 1 Preliminaries I’ll close with an observation. Despite this significant literature on the role of writing in ideation, there are pockets of scholars who do not seem to recognize it. For example, there is not a single paper covering it in The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning.26 1.4 This Book’s Main Contributions The embodied mind literature suggests that we’re not able to discover certain kinds of ideas without exographing. At the same time, exographing is certainly not required for all ideation. For example, consider the invention of yarn. Yarn is basically thread and can be made from a variety of natural and man-made materials. One material is the wool of sheep. Over our his- tory, sheep have been an extremely valuable resource. They can survive in a variety of climates and geographies and can turn just about any vegetation into meat. In addition, they are a source of wool. When shorn and cleaned, the wool is a tangled mass of short fibres, each perhaps two to three inches long. These fibers have a microscopic physical structure such that when two or more are twisted together they make an extremely strong yarn. In ancient times, women used a device called a drop spindle to twist these fibres together. Rather than me explain what a drop spindle is and how it works, I suggest you look at a YouTube video (use the search phrase “drop spindle operation”). These devices are amazing. In fact, it boggles my mind how we came up with such ideas. Obviously, we’d been using woolen sheep hides to make clothes for a long time. What a bright idea to shear these sheep and use the shorn wool to make yarn, then fabric, and then clothes. Over time, we made increasingly better and more complex machines to do all these fundamental transformations. Another example is the atlatl, a device our ancient ancestors innovated to throw a spear more accurately and at a higher speed. Its operation is shown in the following diagram: 26 Keith Holyoak and Robert Morrison, The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005). Livro de minha autoria: CAVALCANTE, Messias S. Comidas dos nativos do Novo Mundo. Barueri, São Paulo. Sá. 2014, 403 p. Note that it’s basically an extension of the thrower’s arm and this is where the added speed comes from. The atlatl is certainly evidence of our imagination and ingenuity and we came up with it long before we ever started to write. So the question is this: why do we need exographing to discover some ideas but not oth- ers? This book’s purpose is to answer the question and then explore its implications. Contribution 1. Exographing Gives Us a Way to Reify Abstract Concepts and Ideas There is no such thing as the number twenty-three in the real world. It’s not like ducks and baseball bats, concrete objects that we can reach out and touch. Our imaginations have brought it into existence through our symbolic ability. We can say “twenty-three” and we can write it on a page (usually “23” but sometimes “twenty-three” or “XXIII”). This reification via exographing brings “23” into our visual field where we’re able to manipulate it and other numbers much as we did stone to make tools 2.5 million years ago. We’ve had a long history of manipulating concrete objects in our visual fields with our hands. Manipulating symbolic concepts on a written page is not much different. The number “23” on a page is just as concrete as ducks and baseball bats. Hence exographing enables this reification of abstract concepts where we are then able to manipulate them to arrive at ideas like 876 × 96 = 84,096. Contribution 2. Without Exographing We Can’t Measure Just think of the tremendous reach of measurement in our economic life. We have incomes measured in dollars, and we spend these incomes on various quantities of goods, each with a price. Business firms measure their costs, revenues, and profits. The stock market has thousands of equities trading in prices that fluctuate minute to minute. We measure how well the economy does as a whole with GDP. There are a number of measures of money supply and we can borrow various amounts from lenders at various interest rates. These measures constitute just a small part of the economic measurement we do. Within science and engineering, the list is just about without limit. The Millau Viaduct in France is one of the largest bridges in the world and its design and construction were marvels of measurement. The moon landing in 1969 took an extraordinary amount of measurement. Considering other aspects of our life, we measure blood pressure and batting averages. We identify the time of day with a digital measurement. The calendar date is also a measure- ment. Our ages are measured in years. The government assigns us numbers for identification purposes. My golf clubs are numbered and these correspond to the distances I can hit the ball with each club. When I cook, I make a lot of measurements, especially when I want to restrict my caloric intake. We measure a President’s approval rating. If you read the NY Times, it’s very difficult to find an article which does not include some reference to a statistic or measurement. All this to say, if we wrote down all of what we measured, it would be a long list. Chapter 1 Preliminaries 17 18 Chapter 1 Preliminaries Let me argue the necessity of exographing for measurement. To be able to measure as we do today, we need a good number system. We’ve been developing number systems for a long time. In fact, we started to develop them about the same time we invented exographing. As I’ll describe later, exographing was invented to solve the administrative problems associ- ated with the agricultural exchange economies that developed in the ancient city-states of Mesopotamia. In these settlements, the administrators had to keep track of who owed what to the temple and palace, and keeping track of it with just human memory became impos- sible. Hence exographing was invented to relieve the cognitive problems associated with transactionally intensive economies. Furthermore, our first attempts at exographing (proto- writing) were at best short inscriptions describing transactions. They were definitely not used to record language in sentences and paragraphs. But this proto-writing did give us the ability to define sophisticated number systems, including operations with those numbers (addition, subtraction, etc.) If you look at societies without writing systems, their number systems are simple. Most of them use just four quanti- ties: none, 1, 2, and many. Some are more sophisticated but not much.27 So the logic is simple: measurement requires a number system, and to discover and use a sophisticated number system requires exographing. The implication is that any sort of sophisticated measurement requires the technology of exographing. I plan to go over the early history of the invention of numbers. As we will see, the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia used small tokens as counters. We don’t know exactly how these systems worked but we know enough about them to say that these early systems were mate- rial in nature.28 Much as a child learns about numbers with manipulatives, our ancestors used three-dimensional counters to do their accounting measurements. In effect, this is embodied thinking using material artifacts. Over time, these ancient accountants graduated from three- dimensional tokens to two-dimensional symbolic notations on clay tablets. Contribution 3. Conceptualizing the Ideasphere and Reconsidering “The Great Divide” The fundamental concept of my development will be the idea. Before we actually produce something like a smart phone, there has to be a lot of thinking and this thinking leads to ideas which in turn ultimately lead to cultural artifacts like smart phones. We’re astonishingly good at generating ideas. The archeological evidence is clear that we began making stone tools about 2.5 million years ago. Progress was slow for hundreds of thousands of years. But around the time of the Agricultural Revolution about 12,000 years ago, our ideation intensity really picked up. My plan is to characterize this ideation and how it’s grown. 27 For example, later in the book, I’ll document the number system of the Oksapmin people of Papua New Guinea. Their number system comprises the first 29 integers and each number is associated with a body part. Hence, in order to have the more complicated system and deal with it cognitively, the Oksapmin have grounded their system in a visual representation. 28 The interested reader is referred to the excellent work of Karenleigh Overmann: The Material Origins of Numbers (Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2019). The anthropologist Wade Davis defined the Ethnosphere to be “the sum total of all thoughts and intuitions, myths and beliefs, ideas and inspirations brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.”29 My definition of the Ideasphere is a slight variation. Since all cultural objects begin as ideas, I define the Ideasphere to be the sum total of all ideas brought into being by the human imagination. This definition and the recognition that certain ideas require exographing to discover lead naturally to a partition of the Ideasphere into the A Class (ideas that require exographing to discover) and the C Class (ideas which don’t require exographing to discover). I then outline the structure of the A Class (what’s in it, what’s not, and the interrelation- ships among these ideas). I’ll argue that the A Class includes the material artifacts of modern life in a techno-literate society, things like computer technology, the Internet, MRI machines, aircraft, and knowledge of the human genome. I’ll then describe how the A Class has grown exponentially over the last 500 years and then suggest that there is no reason to believe that this exponential growth will not continue. Later in the book, I’ll argue that two of our hard- wired characteristics are largely responsible for this growth. One is our enormous curiosity. The other is the so-called ratchet effect, this remarkable ability we have to notice a good idea and then try to improve it. Having defined the A and C Classes, I’ll then wade into a discussion of the root causes of “The Great Divide,” Jack Goody’s name for the vast differences between modern techno- literate societies and oral indigenous societies. Initially, scholars like Goody, Walter Ong, and Eric Havelock explained the difference with exographics. This spawned a significant reaction with most scholars now taking the position that the early scholars were wrong and that the explanation involves education among other factors. I believe that our new understanding of embodied thinking and our use of material cognitive artifacts allows us to argue that exographing is a significant part of the explanation of The Great Divide, and I’ll make that argument in detail. Contribution 4. Explaining the Origin of Our Massively Literate Education System Cultural transmission to the next generation is critical in all societies. Here I’ll appeal to the work of a number of scholars but most especially to the work of Robert Boyd, Peter Richer- son, and Joseph Henrich.30 I’ll begin by looking at cultural transmission in oral indigenous 29 Wade Davis, The Wayfinders: Why Ancient Wisdom Matters in the Modern World (Toronto: Anansi Press, 2009), 2. 30 Interested readers are referred to these books which constitute only a small fraction of the published writings of these scholars: Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, Culture and the Evolutionary Process (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985); Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004); Robert Boyd, A Different Kind of Animal: How Culture Transformed Our Species (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2019); Joseph Henrich, The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017); and Joseph Henrich, The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particu- Chapter 1 Preliminaries 19 larly Prosperous (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2020). 20 Chapter 1 Preliminaries societies. These societies have had to be exceedingly clever in C Class ideation to be able to flourish in their surroundings. I’ll focus on the Inuit who have survived for thousands of years in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. For these societies, the younger generation needs to understand all aspects of hunting, transportation, shelter, and energy to name just a few things on a long list, and this transmission is usually accomplished with a “learn-by-doing” system. In the same way, there must be a cultural transfer to the younger generation in our techno-literate societies. One of our primary ways of doing this is to send our children to school for a considerable period of time to learn the exographing technology and the asso- ciated cultural knowledge that comes with it. There are other aspects of this education, but a literate education is critical for younger people to be able to function in our societies as adults. As time has passed, our education system has become more complex because of our continued expansion of the A Class and the expanding complexity of our societies. In addition, our education system is very much a “learn-by-doing” approach. To learn how to print the letter “a” for example, young primary school students practise doing it. A university student learns calculus by studying examples. Much of our education system is “learn-by-doing.” Here’s the important point. Would we need these massively literate education systems if we had not invented exographing? Surely not! Our modern massively literate education systems have only arisen because we invented exographing. Contribution 5. Assessing the Evidence That Enhancements to Exographing Technologies Lead to Significant Increases in A Class Ideation In Part II of the book, I’ll look at the long history of exographing and its association with A Class expansion. All things equal, we would expect that improvements in exographing technology would lead to A Class expansion. Take for example what happened in ancient Greece. These Greeks perfected a phonetic writing system that was easier to learn than the pictographic/logographic systems that arose in other cultures. This, combined with the Greek belief in a democratic education system (at least for males), resulted in more A Class capability which, in turn, led to an explosion in A Class ideas including ideas in philosophy, mathematics, science, astronomy, literature, drama, and poetry. Overall, the evidence I’ll present in Part II suggests that improvements in exographing technologies played a significant role in the expansion of the A Class. Contribution 6. Assessing the Future of Ideation Technologies and the Ideasphere The conventional wisdom is that we are now well down the road of trying to reproduce the ide- ation abilities of our networked minds with machines. By some accounts, this “singularity” is not far off. But I have my doubts. To make the point, I’ll look at some cases of our substantial A Class ideation. One example is the Wright Brothers and their discovery of the principles of powered flight. Theirs was a story of multi-year experimentation with flyer designs and flight-control surfaces that eventually gave them the principles of the control of powered flight. It is very difficult to imagine how machines would be able to replicate their work, much less work that would result in some new technology that adds as much as what the Wrights discovered. Their work constituted genius-level embodied thinking. In principle, it ought to be doable because, as Rodney Brooks has suggested: “We already have an existence proof ... human beings.”31 But we’re going to need a much better understanding of how net- worked embodied thinking works. A second consideration is whether there are other technologies besides exographing that will enable us to make inroads in the Ideasphere. Up to the invention of exographing, our ideation was restricted to the C Class. But with exographing, we were able to discover the A Class. My question is whether there are other technologies, possibly ones we’ve yet to invent, that will enable us to open up another class of ideas, a class I call the X Class. Since our ability to ideate is so tied to our vision, it could be that the next important technologies are ones that enhance our vision. Alternatively, it could be technologies which enhance our col- laboration in some way, a path we are already pursuing with the growth of the Internet and our search capability of it. At the moment, these are just conjectures. Contribution 7. The Case for a Discipline Which Studies the Technology of Exographing We live in societies steeped in literacy and exographics. All of us spent a lot of time learning the three Rs. You begin, quite early, to learn how to recognize the letters of the alphabet by name, how to print them, and how to sound them. Next you learn to recognize words and finally you start to read and then progress to more difficult texts over time. You also begin to learn how to write, the skill of translating your thoughts to the page. All of this is to prepare you to participate in a highly literate society. Certainly, exographing is fundamental to college and university study. Students use it to take class notes, to do rough work as they put together assignments and essays, to record lab results, to write exams, and so on. Professors use it extensively in teaching and especially in their research. Exographing is endemic to every subject you could possibly study at university. The other side of exographing is reading. When reading, we’re generally embracing someone else’s ideas. I believe that all students would benefit from a course in the fundamental technology they use to think. It would explain embodied thinking, the Ideasphere and its partition into the A and C Classes, the fundamentals of individual thought, the fundamentals of our collaborative networked thought, the history of the exographing technology and how it’s impacted ideation, the role of writing/literacy in education, the role of exographing in Chapter 1 Preliminaries 21 31 Brooks, “Intelligence Without Representation,” 139. 22 Chapter 1 Preliminaries explaining the marked differences between those societies with and without exographing, and our disastrous attempts to take the technology to oral peoples. Finally, I think it’s important to give students a balanced appreciation for the effects of the technology. On the one hand, it’s given us a powerful tool to discover ideas we otherwise couldn’t, and this has given rise to our advanced techno-literate societies. But on the other, it’s spawned a number of problems, including inequality and particularly economic inequal- ity, war and destruction on a global scale, genocide, and the wherewithal to destroy the planet (nuclear proliferation and climate degradation). 1.5 Collaboration and Communication I’ll close this chapter by suggesting what I believe to be the “secret sauce” of our ideation ability. We’re a pretty special ape by any measure. We’ve settled the planet, gone to the moon, and explored our wider solar system with machines and telescopes that report back to us. We’ve built computers, smart phones, and the Internet. We’ve produced great works of art, literature, and music. We invented democracy, markets, money, systems of justice, and systems of education. We can heal many of our ailments and have extended our lifespans by decades. Yet our closest biological relative, the chimpanzee, still lives in the wild doing pretty much what it did millions of years ago. In fact, it wasn’t that long ago in evolutionary time that we were sitting in the trees with them. What happened? One explanation is that we’ve evolved a significant intelligence. But when you get down to it and look at most of us closely, we’re not that impressive. When it comes to the necessities of life, I don’t grow or hunt the food I eat. I didn’t build the house I live in or the car I drive to work. I don’t make my clothes or my shoes or my golf clubs. I certainly didn’t build the computer I work on every day. What I can do is applied mathematics, a skill that makes me a decent living. The implication is clear enough. At least a part of the explanation for our distinctiveness is our remarkable ability to collaborate. The Apollo 11 mission took 300,000 of us working together for the better part of a decade. Some would argue that it took a lot more of us work- ing for thousands of years. Whatever measure you like, that’s a lot of cooperation, especially relative to other species. What helps enable this uber-cooperation is communication, our ability to transfer our ideas from one to another with precision. It’s not clear how we came to speech. How- ever, we know much more about how we came to exographing and I’ll document that later in the book. What’s important to point out here is that, when it comes to ideation, exographing provides additional communication flexibility. We now have access to a great history of ideation over the Internet. Moreover, we’re able to share and search that history quickly and efficiently. In short, exographing, like speech, enables collaboration on a massive scale. Finally, we tend to think of ideation as a solitary exercise, one where a scholar goes off, does his or her thinking, and hatches an idea. The poster-boys are Newton, Einstein, and Darwin. Yes, this solitary thinking is important. Each of these great scholars was socially constructed. They were raised within a literate education system, a system that took them from learning their ABCs to the frontiers of knowledge. And it is only then that they kicked their socially constructed minds into gear to do their great work. Our mind-sharing ability is, by a wide margin, our most important ideation support skill. Yes, it’s you and me. But, more importantly, it’s us.","length":60363,"tokens":13496,"chunks":[{"title":"Preliminaries","content":"Over the last five millennia, we first invented and then refined a technology—writing—to record and share our ideas on a visible medium. I believe it’s made all the difference and I hope to convince you of that in this book. We sometimes think of writing as the representation of speech. But it’s more than that. For example, we now use writing to generate the staff notation of modern music, the symbols of mathematics, and the language of computer coding. I’ll refer to the complete set of these inscribed symbols and representations as exographics. I’ll refer to the act of inscribing them on the medium as exographing. “Exographing” means “writing” but includes more than just the representation of speech. So why is exographing important?

We’re going to see that this set is extraordinarily large, that it’s growing at an exponential rate, and that it gives rise to our advanced techno-literate societies.

But as a result of a fortuitous observation, I got interested in the topic.

At the same time, exographing is certainly not required for all ideation. For example, consider the invention of yarn. Yarn is basically thread and can be made from a variety of natural and man-made materials. One material is the wool of sheep. Over our his- tory, sheep have been an extremely valuable resource. They can survive in a variety of climates and geographies and can turn just about any vegetation into meat. In addition, they are a source of wool. When shorn and cleaned, the wool is a tangled mass of short fibres, each perhaps two to three inches long.","content_length":824,"content_tokens":180,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Preliminaries","content":"These fibers have a microscopic physical structure such that when two or more are twisted together they make an extremely strong yarn.

In fact, it boggles my mind how we came up with such ideas. Obviously, we’d been using woolen sheep hides to make clothes for a long time. What a bright idea to shear these sheep and use the shorn wool to make yarn, then fabric, and then clothes. Over time, we made increasingly better and more complex machines to do all these fundamental transformations.

The atlatl is certainly evidence of our imagination and ingenuity and we came up with it long before we ever started to write. So the question is this: why do we need exographing to discover some ideas but not oth- ers? This book’s purpose is to answer the question and then explore its implications.

We can say “twenty-three” and we can write it on a page (usually “23” but sometimes “twenty-three” or “XXIII”) This reification via exographing brings “23” into our visual field where we’re able to manipulate it and other numbers much as we did stone to make tools 2.5 million years ago.

Without Exographing We Can’t Measure Just think of the tremendous reach of measurement in our economic life. We have incomes measured in dollars, and we spend these incomes on various quantities of goods, each with a price. Business firms measure their costs, revenues, and profits. The stock market has thousands of equities trading in prices that fluctuate minute to minute. We measure how well the economy does as a whole with GDP. There are a number of measures of money supply and we can borrow various amounts from lenders at various interest rates. These measures constitute just a small part of the economic measurement we do. Within science and engineering, the list is just about without limit.","content_length":943,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Preliminaries","content":"The Millau Viaduct in France is one of the largest bridges in the world and its design and construction were marvels of measurement.

My golf clubs are numbered and these correspond to the distances I can hit the ball with each club. When I cook, I make a lot of measurements, especially when I want to restrict my caloric intake. We measure a President’s approval rating. If you read the NY Times, it’s very difficult to find an article which does not include some reference to a statistic or measurement.

To be able to measure as we do today, we need a good number system. We’ve been developing number systems for a long time. In fact, we started to develop them about the same time we invented exographing. As I’ll describe later, exographing was invented to solve the administrative problems associ- ated with the agricultural exchange economies that developed in the ancient city-states of Mesopotamia. In these settlements, the administrators had to keep track of who owed what to the temple and palace, and keeping track of it with just human memory became impos- sible. Hence exographing was invented to relieve the cognitive problems associated with transactionally intensive economies. Furthermore, our first attempts at exographing (proto- writing) were at best short inscriptions describing transactions.","content_length":922,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Preliminaries","content":"They were definitely not used to record language in sentences and paragraphs.

Most of them use just four quanti- ties: none, 1, 2, and many. Some are more sophisticated but not much.27 So the logic is simple: measurement requires a number system, and to discover and use a sophisticated number system requires exographing. The implication is that any sort of sophisticated measurement requires the technology of exographing. I plan to go over the early history of the invention of numbers.

Contribution 3. Conceptualizing the Ideasphere and Reconsidering “The Great Divide” The fundamental concept of my development will be the idea. Before we actually produce something like a smart phone, there has to be a lot of thinking and this thinking leads to ideas which in turn ultimately lead to cultural artifacts like smart phones.

Their number system comprises the first 29 integers and each number is associated with a body part. Hence, in order to have the more complicated system and deal with it cognitively, the Oksapmin have grounded their system in a visual representation. 28 The interested reader is referred to the excellent work of Karenleigh Overmann: The Material Origins of Numbers (Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press, 2019)","content_length":744,"content_tokens":163,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Preliminaries","content":"The anthropologist Wade Davis defined the Ethnosphere to be “the sum total of all thoughts and intuitions, myths and beliefs, ideas and inspirations brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.”29 My definition of the Ideasphere is a slight variation.

This definition and the recognition that certain ideas require exographing to discover lead naturally to a partition of the Ideasphere into the A Class (ideas that require exographing to discover) and the C Class (ideas which don’t require exographing to discover) I then outline the structure of the A Class (what’s in it, what’s not, and the interrelation- ships among these ideas)","content_length":812,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Preliminaries","content":"I’ll argue that the A Class includes the material artifacts of modern life in a techno-literate society, things like computer technology, the Internet, MRI machines, aircraft, and knowledge of the human genome.

The other is the so-called ratchet effect, this remarkable ability we have to notice a good idea and then try to improve it.

In the same way, there must be a cultural transfer to the younger generation in our techno-literate societies.

A university student learns calculus by studying examples. Much of our education system is “learn-by-doing.” Here’s the important point.

These Greeks perfected a phonetic writing system that was easier to learn than the pictographic/logographic systems that arose in other cultures. This, combined with the Greek belief in a democratic education system (at least for males), resulted in more A Class capability which, in turn, led to an explosion in A Class ideas including ideas in philosophy, mathematics, science, astronomy, literature, drama, and poetry.

Up to the invention of exographing, our ideation was restricted to the C Class. But with exographing, we were able to discover the A Class. My question is whether there are other technologies, possibly ones we’ve yet to invent, that will enable us to open up another class of ideas, a class I call the X Class.

All of us spent a lot of time learning the three Rs. You begin, quite early, to learn how to recognize the letters of the alphabet by name, how to print them, and how to sound them. Next you learn to recognize words and finally you start to read and then progress to more difficult texts over time.

Moreover, we’re able to share and search that history quickly and efficiently. In short, exographing, like speech, enables collaboration on a massive scale.

Donald Norman Generally-writing is thought of as a means of communication, one that is different from speaking since written messages can be delivered over space and time. However, there has not been as much research on the use of writing to think. In this chapter, I explore the ratio- nale for writing as a form of external memory in the thinking process. I’ll go over the details of the argument that certain kinds of ideas are not discoverable without writing. From there, I’ll define the Ideasphere, the collection of all the ideas we’ve had since the beginning of human consciousness. Since some ideas require writing to discover, I’ll look at a partition of the Ideasphere into A Class ideas, those ideas that required writing to discover, and the C Class, those ideas that did not require writing to discover. Over this and several succeeding chapters, I’ll argue that the A Class is now a vast set and includes many of the ideas and artifacts that we see in our advanced techno-literate societies. I’ll begin with a definition of exographics. 2.1 Defining Exographics The word “writing” has different meanings depending on the context. For instance, linguists think of a “writing system” as one whose defining purpose is the representation of speech. The technical term for such writing is glottographic writing. Writing also means producing a text like a novel. For primary schoolers, it means practicing their printing. Ignace Gelb wrote one of the first books on what we might term the science of writing.1 Basically he saw writing as a means of communication rather than as a tool of thought. But he wasn’t as restrictive as the linguists. His first chapter is entitled “A System of Signs” and in it, he writes: “However, the general statement that full writing expresses speech should not be taken to mean that it expresses nothing else but speech.”2 He admits the possibility of 1 I. J. Gelb, A Study of Writing (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952). 2 Gelb, A Study of Writing, 15. 25 26 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas writing including mathematics notation and other kinds of non-speech representation but he is clearly focussed on writing as a tool of communication. What I need is a definition of writing that describes our ability to inscribe any symbol on a visual medium. I want it to include things like mathematics notation, music notation, choreo- graphical notation, sketches, data tables, pictures, and basically any visual symbol set that helps thinkers discover an idea. The type of writing that also includes non-speech representations is called semasiographic writing. Rather than give an explicit definition of writing that includes both glottographic and semasiographic components, I felt the better course was to use a new word. There have been a variety of terms suggested for the representation of thought on a visual medium external to the mind. One is external representation. Another is TEXT as defined by Elaine Treharne and Claude Willan.3 Karl Lashley defined an engram to be a memory record stored inside the human nervous system.4 For example, our long-term memory record “2+3=5” is an engram. In contrast, Merlin Donald defined an exogram to be a memory record stored outside the nervous system.5 For example, my wife’s written list of items I take to the grocery store is an exogram. If a music composer records a promising chord sequence on a smart phone, the recording is an exogram. In a subsequent paper, Donald uses the terms exogram and exographics interchangeably. I’ll put the term exographics at the heart of my argument and define it this way: Definition. An exographic is a set of persistent meaningful symbols (words, pictures, graphs, etc.) stored on a visible medium usually for the purpose of ideation. Exographing is the act of inscribing these representations on the medium. So an exographic could be glottographic or semasiographic writing and you can think of exographing as the writing you do to produce exographics. The root word of “exographics” is “graphic” meaning some sort of visual representation. The prefix “exo” means “out of” and, in this case, “out of the mind.” The Notion of Persistence An important concept in the definition is that exographics are persistent, meaning they are sta- tionary over time. You can stare at a page of exographics and the symbols on that page do not move. They are motionless and you can look at them for as long as you want. Contrast that to the content of speech which “disappears” almost as quickly as it is spoken. Speech is ephemeral. Perhaps the best way to understand persistence is to look at examples of text that are not persistent. For example, in videos with subtitles, the words a speaker says appear simultane- ously on the screen as text and disappear shortly after they are spoken. In this way, these 3 Elaine Treharne and Claude Willan, Text Technologies: A History (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2019). 4 Karl Lashley, “In Search of the Engram,” in Society for Experimental Biology, Physiological Mechanisms in Animal Behavior (Society’s Symposium IV) (Cambridge: Academic Press, 1950). 5 Merlin Donald, Origins of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the Evolution of Culture and Cognition (Cambridge: Har- vard University Press, 1991). visual words have the same characteristic as the aural words: cognitively, they vanish after they are spoken. We pick up the narrative’s gist but we certainly don’t remember the exact words. This makes doing something like mathematics difficult. Mathematics, by its nature, requires that we see the detail for enough time to understand it. Hence, if a string of math- ematical symbols were running across a video screen, we would have to stop the video in order to study the details. Another example is a person using sign language. This is certainly symbolic output in our visual field but it is hardly persistent. The words disappear cognitively in the same way spoken words do. Roman Jakobson was the first to emphasize the importance of persistence.6 Certainly some scholars did not seem to understand the nature of exographics being persistent. For example, Eric Havelock wrote this: “The eye can review, that is, retrospect: the ear and mouth cannot.”7 As the example of movie subtitles makes clear, the eye cannot always review visual text. Hence persistence is not inherent in our cognitive skill set but rather it is a char- acteristic: of the medium we choose to present the symbols. Some time ago, I coached university football in Canada on the defensive side of the ball. A big part of coaching is figuring out what an opposing offence is doing. On game day, this is very difficult. In Canadian football, you have to look at 12 opposing players. Seeing what each does on plays that average 6 seconds in length is a cognitive impossibility. Fortunately, at the time I coached, the rules required teams to trade video recordings of their last three games. We could then use these recordings to figure out what our next opponent was doing. We basically studied what every offensive player did on every play. To figure out, say, what the left tackle was doing on a play, we would roll the video-tape over and over, sometimes in slow-motion. The beauty of the tape is that the play becomes persistent. What might have taken 6 seconds in real time, takes about 10–15 minutes to analyze by running and re-running the tape. So just because something is in our visual frame doesn’t mean it’s persistent. The industrialist Leland Stanford (he and his wife founded Stanford University) had a keen interest in horses and gait analysis. At the time, it was not known whether all of a horse’s feet were ever off the ground when running. In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge was able to take a quick series of photographs of one of Stanford’s horses and some of these showed clearly that the horse’s feet were all off the ground. The human eye is not able to discern this because the horse’s legs move too quickly. Yet, with the camera, reality becomes persistent. Types of Exographics There are two types. One is the finished exographics we do to communicate ideas to oth- ers. It could be a paper in a journal, a book, or a composer’s finished sheet music. There is also rough exographics, which is the non-formal writing we do as we work through an idea. 6 Roman Jakobson, “On the Relation between Visual and Auditory Sign,” in Selected Writings II, (The Hague: Mouton, 1971), 338–344. 7 Eric Havelock, Prologue to Greek Literacy, (Cincinnati: University of Cincinaati Press, 1971), 53. Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 27 28 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas It would include, say, the notes a historian makes at an archive, the rough work a mathematician does to arrive at a theorem, the lab notes a chemist makes while doing an experiment, and the initial sketches of an architect to arrive at a design proposal. Basically, rough exographics are used in the ideation process and finished exographics for communicating the idea. Let’s now clarify these types with some examples. Here is a snippet of Einstein’s rough exographics leading to his paper on special relativity:8 Note that his famous equation E=mc2 is displayed. You can tell this is rough exographics because it’s handwritten and one of the words on the bottom line is crossed out. The following diagram by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1590 CE) is believed to be the first exploded-view sketch of a machine: 8 https://ro. pinterest. com/pin/254805291387433814/visual-search/ Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1590) This is rough exographics because it’s done by hand. Here are the first three paragraphs of a draft of Charles Dickens’s (1812–1870) A Christmas Carole:9 This is clearly a rough exographic. Here are the same paragraphs as a finished exographic: STAVE I MARLEY’S GHOST MARLEY was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge’s name was good upon ‘Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as adoor-nail. Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail. When a thinker is working through an idea, they will be producing rough exographics. It is only when the idea is complete that we would see a finished exographic. For example, a mathematician might produce pages of rough exographics working through examples to see a general pattern in the problem she is studying. It might be that these pages of rough exographics lead to only a single paragraph in the finished exographic of the idea. For this Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 29 9 https://www. gutenberg. org/files/30368/30368-h/30368-h. htm 30 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas reason, I like the analogy of an iceberg. The finished exographic is the part of the iceberg you see above the water, and all of the thinking and rough exographics that go into discovering the idea is that part you don’t see below the water. The Craft of Finished Exographics As students, you’ve been asked to produce many finished exographics. Whether it’s a his- tory essay, a book review for an English class, a mathematics assignment, or a chemistry lab report, your instructors have asked you to compose a finished exographic that is coherent and well written. Very often, the requirement is to write sentences and paragraphs. As you no doubt appreciate, this is a difficult skill to acquire. It takes a lot of practice to be able to produce good prose. As I see it, it’s one of the most important skills you will develop as you move through your education. Effectively, you’re learning to write, and as I have argued above, this skill is intimately related to your ability to think. Writing a decent sentence is an exercise in logic. A student once submitted this sen- tence to me in response to a writing exercise asking them to describe what they read for pleasure: I enjoy reading autobiographies of people. In one sense, this is a good sentence because I understand the idea the student is trying to convey. But in another, it’s not. There is no need for the words “reading” and “of people” since autobiographies are always read and are always about people. As it turned out, the student meant “biographies” rather than “autobiographies.” Hence, the sentence could have been written: I enjoy biographies. which is the same idea as the original with half the words. Basically, you need to look at any sentence you’ve written and make two assessments: Does this sentence convey the idea I intended? and Is there a way to write it with fewer words? When my answer to the first question is no, I often don’t know how to change the sentence to get the desired result. I find this fascinating: my mind can easily conclude that a given sen- tence doesn’t express what I want to convey but, at the same time, I sometimes have no idea how to fix it. This is the hard part of writing. As for the second question, the more you prac- tice, the better you will get at changing the words so that fewer are required. For example, rather than “at this point in time,” you could write “now.” I’ll not have much to say about finished exographics as there are many good books available on how to write well. 2.2 Ideation Technics Exographics are two-dimensional visual representations that help us to discover ideas. But as the literature on embodied thinking makes clear, we use many kinds of artifacts in the environment to help us think. When an artifact is a part of the process to help us think, I’m going to refer to it as an ideation technic. An exographic is a special case of ideation technic. Another example is an electronic calculator. Still another is Computer Aided Design (CAD), the software codes that allow engineers and architects to do design work much more quickly than if they were doing it by hand. Gaudí’s Approach to Architectural Design The Spanish architect, Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926 CE), is famous for a number of structures, most notably the Sagrada Familia Basilica in Barcelona. Even though it’s not yet complete, it is breathtakingly beautiful. Basically, an architect has two problems. He or she wants to make sure a proposed struc- ture is structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing. These days, most architects leave the issue of whether a building will stand to structural engineers. But Gaudí was able to assess both aspects with his “hanging chain” models (a three-dimensional exogram). He began with a scaled floor plan on a board that he attached to a ceiling. He then suspended weights from strings hanging down from the board. Here is a picture of the hanging chain model for the Sagrada Familia: Once the model was constructed, he took pictures of it and then turned the pictures upside down to see what it would look like. This technique allowed him to judge the effects of changes in design quickly. Architects have used scaled 3D models of their proposed structures Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 31 © BYphoto/Alamy Stock Photo 32 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas since the Renaissance. But Gaudí took it to a new level with his approach. This hanging chain model is an ideation technic. Matthew Bourne’s Approach to Choreography Choreographers work in remarkably similar says to music composers. Matthew Bourne, the celebrated British choreographer, will experiment with dancers over a two-week period. At his direction, he films perhaps a hundred phrases and snippets with the dancers sometimes making suggestions to Bourne as the experiment proceeds. Then, with this collection of video clips, he “connects” them into a larger piece. He does live experiments along the way to see what a combination of these snippets looks like. His preferred compositional medium— videotape—is an ideation technic. While some choreographers use exographics (pictures of sequential foot movements on a page) to record movement, Bourne does not because he is forever tinkering with a piece. The video is an ideation technic. 2.3 Imagination I live in a small city on the northern shore of Lake Ontario. It can get pretty cold in the winter so sometimes I like to take an imaginary trip to a warmer place. Most of the time it’s to Paris. In my mind’s eye, it’s a late Sunday morning in early May, the sun is shining, and it’s unseasonably warm. My wife and I have just walked from our apartment in the Marais to the Bastille and we’re seated at an outdoor bistro surrounded by Parisians and other visi- tors who’ve also been drawn out by a perfect day. We sit and chat idly, taking in the sun, the warmth, and the people. Usually, this trip only lasts a few minutes but it’s a nice refuge when the reality outside is thirty below. The important point about this sketch is that I can bring it up on demand. In fact, the distinguishing feature of our species is how we process information. As nearly as we can tell, we’re the only species who can imagine different worlds on demand and then communicate the details of those worlds to others. Newton imagined a phantasm called gravity, his concept for the glue that holds the uni- verse together. Shakespeare imagined the tragic story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Our deep ancestors imagined that a useful tool could be had by chipping one stone with another. All of us can imagine alternative realities. For example, suppose you have an important one-on-one meeting with your superior in several day’s time about the new project you’ve been pushing. In preparation, you are likely to simulate in your mind the possible paths this meeting could take, as well as forecast the concerns and questions your superior is likely to have. Your superior will likely be going through the same sort of preparation. Imagination is a powerful skill. This book will focus on how we exploit our imaginations with exographics. We’ll begin by outlining two of our important skills in ideation supported by exographics: symbolic rep- resentation and abstraction. Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 33 2.4 Abstraction and Symbolic Representation Consider the following picture: It has three groups of objects. For the purposes of this book, the notation <*> means that there is a symbol between the angular brackets. I’ll use the notation <balloon> to refer to the objects in the group on the left. Sometimes, I’ll want to distinguish a verbal symbol (I hear it) from an exographics symbol (I see it). In the case where I say the word balloon, I’ll use <balloon>v and when I write it, I’ll use <balloon>e. So what are symbols? They are purely arbitrary utterances or notations for the object we wish to refer to or represent. There is nothing about <balloon>v or <balloon>e that give any indication of the thing these symbols are referring to. They just happen to be the symbols we’ve agreed on. The second thing worth noting is that, over a life of experience, each of us has built up a significant common inventory of these symbols and they allow us to share our ideas a skill very important for collaboration. Children are incredibly flexible in their use of symbols. For instance, a child might hold a small length of block so that one end is over his ear and the other is at his mouth. When he then speaks into the one end of the block close to his mouth, he is thinking of the block as a telephone. Maybe two minutes later, the boy will hold the block in his hand with it stretched above his head and then run around the room making a sound as though the block is an air- plane. One minute the block is a telephone; the next it’s an airplane. The block is symbolic. But it’s a different kind of symbolic. When this same child speaks the words of his native language, he is using symbols that his society has agreed on. At play, children are inventing their own symbols for referents. This is where we excel as a species. We’re really good with symbols. Mumut/Shutterstock. com Mumut/Shutterstock. com © BYphoto/Alamy Stock Photo/Shutterstock. com 34 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas There is some evidence that we’ve had this symbolization skill for a while. Recently, researchers discovered a 44,000-year-old cave painting on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.10 In one of the paintings, there is a figure that appears to be a man with a beak and a tail. While it’s hard to know for sure what was going on in this ancient artist’s mind, this appears to be a case where the artist has substituted animal parts for their human counterparts. This is cer- tainly evidence of symbolic thinking. No doubt the artist had a model of a man and a model of a bird, each with all its component parts. The artist then imagined combining these two models to come up with the man/animal hybrid in the painting. It’s an approach artists have used for some time. For example, the ancient Greeks invented minotaurs, sirens, satyrs, and many other composite human/animal forms. Let’s now come back to the group of three balloons. We can speak about four related objects: the symbol we speak, <balloon>v; the symbol we write, <balloon>e; the referent, the actual ontological object in the real world that we’re referring to with our symbols; and the concept (or meaning) of <balloon> we store in our minds. This stored concept will include a lot of information and knowledge of balloons that we’ve accumulated over time. Even though we think of this group as three balloons, there is a sense in which they are different. Each projects a different wavelength of reflected light and we use the symbol <colour> to refer to this characteristic. There is a red balloon, a blue, and a gold. Colour is not like a cat or car because it doesn’t exist by itself in the real world. You can’t reach out and touch colour. In this case, it exists as a characteristic of a balloon. We refer to such concepts that have no concrete referent as an abstract concept. Let’s now look at all three groups in the picture. Even though these groups are of differ- ent objects (balloons, penguins, and cars), there is a sense in which each group is the same. If we count the number of objects in each group, we get the same number: three. Again, we can’t reach out and touch numberness, or, in this case, threeness. Hence, numberness and threeness are abstractions. But we can reify the concept “threeness” with these symbols: <3>e, <three>v, <three>e, and <III>e. Let’s step back and think about the invention of language. About 3–4 million years ago, our ancestors were a small-headed ape, Australopithecus, and it’s clear from their skeletal remains, that they could not have had a voice box and the related parts that enable a modern human to speak. But at some point, between then and now, an ancestor species started to speak. Recall at the end of the first chapter that I suggested our most important cognitive skill was mind-sharing and collaboration. If there was a way to get to this wonderful idea of speech, we were the ape to do it. At the heart of speech is our ability to symbolize, to associate meaning with arbitrary physical movements (i. e., ges- ture) and/or sounds. If speech wasn’t amazing enough, we then invented exographics about 5,000 years ago. Initially, these were short pictorial inscriptions of economic transactions. Over time, they 10 Maxime Aubert, Rustan Lebe, Agus Oktaviana, et al., “Earliest Hunting Scene in Prehistoric Art,” Nature 576 (2019): 442–445. bloomed into a full-blown representation of language. Again, by inscribing symbols on a medium, we’re able to communicate a meaning to a reader. The symbol <apple>e has a well understood meaning. As it turns out, much of our lexicon is abstract. <justice> is abstract and, by definition, does not have a corresponding physical reality. How, then, would our ancestors who invented the word have come to a shared understanding of it? It had to have been that they discussed its meaning with words which had been previously defined, some of which could have been the representations of abstract ideas. Let’s make the example a little more understandable. How would we have come to the representation <three>? <three> is an abstract concept. As I explained above, there is no real- world referent for this concept. It’s a derivative concept in the sense that it’s a characteristic of a group of objects. As I’ll detail later in the book, it took us a long time to get to a stand-alone number three. There were a number of stages we went through before one of our ancestors realized that <three> could be a stand-alone idea. It was only after we invented exographics that we realized this. In short, abstract ideas and their symbolic representations are difficult to discover. Thankfully, language and exographics extend our capability by enabling us to invent concepts and express ideas for which there is no corresponding physical reality. A good example of what I mean comes from the work of Andrew Wiles who managed to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, a problem in mathematics that had been open since Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665 CE) conjectured the theorem some 350 years ago. Wiles’s accomplish- ment is considered one of the great contributions to 20th-century mathematics. The proof itself is over 100 pages of dense mathematics. Here is his statement of Proposition 1: Proposition 1. Suppose that 𝒪 is a complete discrete valuation ring and that φ : S → T is a surjective local 𝒪-algebra homomorphism between com- plete local Noetherian 𝒪-algebras. Suupose further that 𝔭T is a prime ideal of T such that T/𝔭 →~ 𝒪 and let 𝔭 5φ21(𝔭 ). Assume that TST (i) T~–𝒪[[x1,...,xr]]/(f1,...,fr−u) where r is the size of a minimal set of 𝒪-generators of 𝔭 /𝔭2 , TT (ii) φ induces an isomorphism 𝔭 /𝔭2 →~ 𝔭 /𝔭2 and that these are finitely SSTT generated 𝒪-modules whose free part has rank u. Then d is an isomophism.11 Mathematics has come a long way since we were able to separate the idea of a stand-alone number from the object that was being counted. In Wiles’s proposition statement, there are a great number of abstract concepts, some of which would take a long time to explain even to students with a high level of training in mathematics. I am going to reserve the special term reification for the process of bringing an abstract idea to our visual field with exographics. For example, we can reify the idea of three using the symbol <3>e. More importantly, <3>e is just as concrete as an apple or a bear. 11 Andrew Wiles, “Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat’s Last Theorem,” Annals of Mathematics 141 (1995): 545. Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 35 36 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas Here is the important point about reification: we bring whatever abstract concept we are reifying into our visual field and it is in this field that it’s persistent and amenable to manipulation. Hence, with reification, we’re able to discover that 876 × 96 is 84,096. Reifica- tion enabled Einstein to discover Special Relativity, Newton the laws of universal gravitation, and Darwin, the idea of evolution by natural selection. 2.5 The Saxe Principle of Exographic System Change The anthropologist Geoffrey Saxe has suggested a mechanism for how representations evolve over time: Saxe Principle. The collective system of representations emerges over time as the unintended consequences of local goal-directed actions of individuals.12 By “collective system of representations” he means the representations that a particular culture arrives at and with “the unintended consequence of local goal-directed actions of individuals” he suggests that the underlying mechanism has an evolutionary flavour where an “environment” influences the optimizing choices of individuals. But there is a key difference. Whereas the biology of natural selection and the environment constitute the so-called blind watch-maker,13 the underpinnings of symbolic change—individual goal-seeking behavior within a given environment—is a process where the watch-maker has some limited vision. Denise Schmandt-Besserat and others (more on this later) have suggested that the ancient Sumerians represented one unit of a particular good with a small token having a particular shape: For instance, small and large units of grain were counted with cones and spheres, oil with ovoids, animals with cylinders and the units of labor with tetrahedrons. Perhaps the single most archaic feature of the token system was to be used in one- to-one correspondence. Two jars of oil were shown by two ovoids and three jars of oil were marked by three ovoid tokens.14 So, initially, 23 units of labour would have been represented by 23 tetrahedrons. Some cen- turies later, the ancient Babylonians represented the number 23 by making the following inscription on clay: 12 Geoffrey Saxe, with Indigo Esmonde, Cultural Development of Mathematical Ideas (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 3–4. 13 Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design (New York: Norton, 1987). 14 Denise Schmandt-Besserat, “Tokens and Writing: the Cognitive Development,” Scripta 1 (September 2009): 147. Left to right, the first two symbols represent 10s and these are followed by three 1s. That’s certainly more efficient that fashioning 23 ovoid tokens. Centuries later we would arrive at a place-holder system and the symbol “23.” 2.6 Extending Biological Memory with Exographics Let’s consider the arithmetic problem again. Imagine that you have to get the product 864 × 86 and that you have been momentarily deprived of writing, calculators, computers, and any other such device that would help you get the product. What this means is that you have to get it with your unaided mind. Let me explain how I did this problem. I envisioned the problem this way: 864 ×86 ££££ ££££ £££££ This is the standard approach to getting a product that I learned in primary school. My task was to fill in the boxes. The only thing allowed in my visual field were the numbers to be multiplied: 864 × 86. While there are now more complicated models, a simple model of our memory is that we have a Working Memory (WM) and a Long-Term Memory (LTM).15 Our WM is where we think and reason. For example, suppose I was given the problem 43 × 7. I could do this in my WM by first retrieving 7 × 3 = 21 from my LTM. Then in my working memory, I would set aside the 1 as the last digit in the answer and carry the 2. Then I would get 7 × 4 = 28, again from my LTM, and then add the carried 2 to get 30. I would conclude the answer is 301. There are other ways to do this product (i. e., (40 × 7) + (3 × 7) = 301), but save for a few LTM calls, most of us could do the computation in our WMs easily. There is no need for exographics. Returning to the calculation of 864 × 86, I began by getting 864 × 6 = 5,184, the third row (the highest row of boxes). Then I went through the calculation of 864 × 8 to get the fourth row, 6,048. But when I got the fourth row, I had forgotten the third row. So I redid the third row, only to forget the fourth! I then decided to commit both intermediate products, 864 × 6 = 5,184 and 864 × 9 = 6,048, to my LTM. This took a lot of rehearsal. Eventually I decided 15 For more information on the structure of WM, readers are referred to Alan Baddeley’s compendium Working Memory, Thought, and Action (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007). Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 37 38 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas to “chunk” them. For example, for 864 × 6 = 5,184, I associated the names “Butkus/Moss.” These are NFL players: Dick Butkus wore the number 51 and Randy Moss wore 84. For the second, I considered that 6,048 was two chunks, 60 and 48. The first is the number of min- utes in an hour and the second is the number of hours in 2 days. This chunking enabled me to do the addition of the third and fourth rows in my WM by making a series of LTM calls to where I had stored the 51/84 and 60/48 chunks to get the digits I had to add for each column. Keep in mind that while I was doing these single digit additions, I had to also keep track of the final answer as I assembled it. The complete calculation took me about 40 minutes and most of this time was taken up with committing the third and fourth rows to my LTM. I didn’t get the correct answer because I forgot to add a carry as I was assembling the final number. So right away we see the problem: my WM is not very big and my LTM is hard to write. This point about WM capacity goes back to the seminal work of George Miller.16 But the small capacity of WM would not be an issue if LTM were easy to write. Hence, it’s the com- bination of the two which doesn’t allow me to do the calculation quickly internally. The problem is certainly not solved by the availability of language. If someone said to me “To get the final answer, you have to add five thousand one hundred and eight-four to six thousand forty-eight,” I’d forget the numbers before the speaker got to the end of the sen- tence. Our aural medium is not much help. But when I am able to use exographics, I can record the third and fourth lines on paper and therefore bypass the requirement of having to put these into my LTM. It enables me to do the final column additions in my WM recording the answer digit by digit on paper as I move from the column on the right to the final column on the left. I’m effectively extending my biological WM with exographics. Keep in mind that exographics aren’t cheap. We all spend most of our childhood and teenage education years steeped in an exographics education system. For me to do this arithmetic in my head required a lot of focus, no distractions, and men- tal energy. If I had to do this sort of thinking all day, I’d be exhausted. Hence, for a given level of mental energy, exographics extends the volume of work we can do. Let’s now think about a 3-digit by 3-digit multiplication. These are very hard for me to do in my head, but over the years, I’ve had students who are able to do them quickly, sometimes in a matter of a few minutes. When I ask them, they tell me they do the problem the same way I do—they envision the same algorithm. Obviously, they have much larger WMs than I do. But even these students have limits. If I give them a big enough problem, they can’t do it.17 It’s worth noting that there are special individuals—mnemonists—with LTMs that are easy to write. Alexander Luria, in his book The Mind of the Mnemonist, describes the 16 George Miller, “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Informa- tion,” The Psychological Review 63, no. 2 (March 1956). 17 There are savants who are capable of prodigious feats of calculation. In a 1907 paper, Frank Mitchell describes the ability of Zerah Colburn, an 8-year old American boy. He was able to get the 16th power of 8 (= 281,474,976,710,656) in front of an audience in London. See Frank Mitchell, “Mathematical Prodigies,” The American Journal of Psychology 18, no. 1, (Jan., 1907): 65. remarkable mind of Mr. S. (or just S.).18 Whether S. heard or read information, there seemed to be no limit to what he could recall. Lists of 70 random syllables could be recalled perfectly 15 years later. Moreover, this did not appear to affect his abstract reasoning ability appre- ciably and, in some cases, he was able to solve simple problems very quickly. S. is the rare case where there does not appear to be a distinction between his WM and LTM. Effectively, he wrote his LTM with only the perceptual effort required to read or hear what was to be remembered. This arithmetic example demonstrates that I can’t discover certain kinds of ideas with- out exographics. Of course, this begs the question of what other kinds of ideas are not discoverable. 2.7 The Nature of Arguments At universities, scholars make arguments to justify the positions they take. Whether it’s in economics, sociology, mathematics, or any other discipline, the scholar will make a claim and then try to justify/prove the claim. For example, in his great book On the Origin of Species, Darwin argued evolution by natural selection. It’s a long argument, about 502 pages. I am not interested in the detailed logic of arguments. I only need their generic structure. There are two types of logical arguments: inductive and deductive. The two require much different approaches. But even so, the “look” of both is similar because each comprises a set of statements. If you look at On the Origin of Species, it’s a series of statements (English sentences) from start to end. There are only a few diagrams and these serve to explicate some of the statements he makes. Let’s look at some other arguments. Here’s a very small part of Aristotle’s Organon taken from “Prior Analytics”: First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. If no B is A, neither can any A be B. For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B. But if every B is A then some A is B. For if no A were B, then no B could be A. But we assumed that every B is A. Similarly too, if the premiss is particular. For if some B is A, then some of the As must be B. For if none were, then no B would be A. But if some B is not A, there is no necessity that some of the As should not be B; e. g. let B stand for animal and A for man. Not every animal is a man; but every man is an animal. First note that it’s a sequence of statements. To make this clear, I’ll list the first three: Statement 1: First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. Statement 2: If no B is A, neither can any A be B. 18 Alexander Luria, The Mind of the Mnemonist (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987). Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 39 40 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas Statement 3: For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B. Second, the statements are logically related. For instance, the meaning of Statement 2 is uncertain unless we’ve read Statement 1. Statement 3’s meaning is unclear unless we’ve read Statements 1 and 2, and so on. Keep in mind that the sampling above is only a small part of the Organon. There are thousands of statements which precede it and follow it. But the structure is clear. The Orga- non constitutes an exographic idea defined to be a sequence of logically connected exo- graphic statements. Another example is Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published in 1776. Here is the first paragraph: In the second century of the Christian Era, the empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilized portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valor. The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines. It is the design of this, and of the two succeeding chapters, to describe the prosperous condition of their empire and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by the nations of the earth. It is not until Chapter 38 that Gibbon gets to his thesis, that Rome crumbled from within: The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians. Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 41 The complete six-volume argument is a sequence of statements with a logical thread connect- ing them into a whole. The General Structure of Arguments Let’s represent this structure with [S1, S2, . . ., Sn, C] where S1, S2, . . ., Sn is an ordered sequence of statements and C is the claim. The statements are related since, taken in sequence, they lead to the logical conclusion C. To keep it simple, in order to produce some statements in the argument, we will need to appeal to the information in one or more prior statements. In the absence of exographics, it would be necessary to keep this prior information in WM. Clearly, as the argument gets more complex, and we have to keep more and more of this information in WM, we soon run into problem, much as I did trying to get an answer to the arithmetic problem above. Most ideas have a local independence property. What this means is that a thinker can focus on a small part of the idea pretty much to the exclusion of all other parts of the idea. For example, consider the argument justifying the solution of an equation in mathematics: 3x – 6 = 9. My first step would be to add 6 to both sides of the equation: 3x = 15. At this point, I can divide both sides by 3 to get the solution x = 5. Note that, when I am doing the manipulation to get to the third equation, I only have to consider the second equation, 3x = 15. I don’t have to go back to the first equation. This is because the second equation is equivalent to the first in the sense that the same value of x will solve both equations. In this way, I can focus on a small part of the problem and there is no need to worry about other statements in the derivation. This independence lessens the cognitive requirement on memory but does not eliminate it. Here is another example. Suppose we needed to sum the first 10 integers. The argument has the following structure: S1: 1 + 2 = 3 S2: 3 + 3 = 6 S3: 6 + 4 = 10 S4: 10 + 5 = 15 S5: 15 + 6 = 21 S6: 21 + 7 = 28 S7: 28 + 8 = 36 S8: 36 + 9 = 45 C: 45 + 10 = 55 42 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas Note that to complete this argument, we just have to remember the result of the previous statement and then add the next integer to it. This is an argument we can easily make in our WMs. Full independence is not possible with some ideas. For instance, a novelist writing Chapter 10 doesn’t have to worry too much about Chapter 2 but, since there is a logical connection between the two chapters, the author cannot contradict the plot and character development of Chapter 2 in Chapter 10. I should probably have used the term “near independence” but “nearly local independence” is a mouthful. Regardless of terminology, most abstract arguments tend to have this independence property and this makes their ideation easier. Another way to characterize this property is with the concept of bilevel control. For exam- ple, as a novelist works on the word-to-word details of the story in Chapter 10, he or she has in mind the “gist” of the story—where it has been and where it’s going. She has no memory record of exactly what’s been written in any of the previous chapters but she is aware of the story’s gist. As the novelist adds words to the story, she needs to make those words fit together (lower level control) while at the same time ensuring that those words are consistent with the gist of the story (upper level control). I refer to this upper and lower-level control as bilevel control. An interesting case of the argument structure above comes from one of our greatest math- ematicians, Leonhard Euler (1707–1783 CE). Euler did some of his best mathematics when he was blind. If you’re blind, exographics is not much use to you directly. So how did he do it? As it turns out, he used scribes (one a son) who were themselves good mathematicians. He would dictate to them, and they would write it down and check that Euler made the calculation cor- rectly. One thing you have going for you in mathematics is that, most of the time, you only have to carry the last step in your memory. For example, if you are solving an equation, once you complete a line of simplification, there is no need to check any of the previous lines. Clearly, this is the same structure of argument as the sum of the first 10 digits argument. The Tedium of Argument Without Exographics It is possible to ideate some relatively complex abstract ideas without exographics. As Mil- man Parry has argued, the Homerian epics were performed orally long before they were ever written down.19 The implication is that they were composed without exographics. The Odys- sey is 12,000-plus lines and the Iliad is longer. Admittedly both epics are narratives and thus easier to memorize particularly with the oral-formulaic technique for retelling. Nonetheless, there is still some significant memory work to do. As I’ve explained, when I’ve tried to do a 3-digit by 2-digit product, it takes me a long time. Let’s come back to the arithmetic problem, 864 × 69. To get it, I had to remember the results of the particular prior statements 864 × 6 = 5,184 and 864 × 9 = 6,048. Hence, I had to have both 5,184 and 6,048 in my WM at the same time that I was adding them. This turned 19 A summary of Parry’s work can be found in a volume edited by his son, Adam Parry, The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987). out to be impossible for me and I ended up have to store both in my LTM in order to allow my limited WM to do the addition one column at a time. This arithmetic problem makes it clear that the question doesn’t have to be very complex before you bump into WM capacity. Storing intermediate results in my LTM takes a lot of mental energy. As a result, once I finish the calculation, I’m tired. Or what about Gibbon’s difficulty in constructing his argu- ment. How could he have argued his idea (the complete set of statements in the six volumes) in his head? Obviously, he couldn’t. If there is no such thing as exographics, Gibbon’s history would not exist. Bear in mind that I am not concerned with Gibbon’s problem of communi- cating his idea. I’m just focussed on him thinking it through. Even if you’re able to get through the tedium of thinking through a complex abstract idea without exographics, what do you do with it when you’re done? For a society to preserve whatever the knowledge happens to be, the thinker must transfer it to other LTMs and, in the absence of exographics, this has to be done orally. Think of the difficulty of Gibbon transfer- ring his argument to another mind orally! In sum, Norman’s epigraph at the head of the chapter is appropriate: the power of the unaided mind is highly overrated. 2.8 A Digression on Darwin and Exographics It’s difficult to overstate the profundity of Darwin’s idea. In the 19th century, in an age where Christian orthodoxy was that we were made by a Creator in his image and likeness, Dar- win offered a much different story. He suggested that all species were related (man to trees, flowers, and other animal species). Furthermore, he argued that we had built-in biological mechanisms that produced intra-species variation and only those most suited to the environ- ment they found themselves in would survive to reproduce and pass on their characteristics to the next generation. It’s a powerful idea, one that is now accepted by the vast majority of the scientific community. Above I suggested that Darwin’s presentation of the idea in his book On the Origins of Species (or just Origins) is an argument consisting of a sequence of statements that leads to the claim of evolution by natural selection. The book is Darwin’s finished exographics of his idea. But to discover that idea, there were many years of study, thinking, and rough exograph- ics. Cambridge University Library holds the “Charles Darwin Papers” which comprises over 30,000 digitized pages spanning the period 1835–1882.20 Part I Creation of the Origin of Species covers the period 1837–1859 and includes notebooks and papers (rough exograph- ics) going back to the voyage of the Beagle. Over these notes, Darwin develops his ideas and eventually he is ready to produce Origins (finished exographics). His notebook corpus is an astonishing volume of rough exographics and gives you some justification for my iceberg metaphor concerning the ratio of finished exographics to rough Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 43 20 See https://cudl. lib. cam. ac. uk/collections/darwin_mss/1. 44 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas exographics. The “1842 Pencil Sketch” is one of Darwin’s early attempts to summarize the idea. If you look at it closely, you will see that it is indeed rough. It is handwritten with lots of sections of text crossed out.21 It’s clear evidence of a scientist’s imagination at work, going back and forth with the page, to bring his ideas to the surface. This is clear evidence that exograph- ics played an important role in the development of perhaps the cleverest scientific idea to date. It’s worth looking at the last paragraph of Origins: It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less- improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.22 It’s a marvelous concluding paragraph. He begins with a description of the great variety of species of living things on a bank presumably next to a stream or brook. He then goes over the highlights of how natural selection works and then offers this summary: “from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows.” What is compelling is the next sentence: “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one.” This is a clear tip of the hat to the Creator. Darwin was a Christian and at one point at Cambridge seriously considered becoming an ordained minister. Surprisingly, he had the great fortitude to give his version of the creation story. He admits a God (“life . . . having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one”), but one consistent with his view of the scientific facts which led to evolution. 21 See https://cudl. lib. cam. ac. uk/view/MS-DAR-00006/21. 22 Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (New York: Appleton, 1861), 425. 2.9 A Digression on the Cognitive Equivalence of Certain Exographics In some influential work, Eugene Ferguson traced the historical use of visualization and sketching in engineering and technology.23 He suggested that a technologist/engineer has a vision, a complete picture in his mind of what the gadget will look like, and then reproduces that vision on paper. I don’t think this is true for most engineers based on the fact that we have a limited size scratchpad (WM) as I’ve already argued. But we could argue it another way. If there is a class of humans who are able to generate a complete one-time vision of something, then surely its artists, and among these, Picasso has to have been one of the best. But I don’t think he had these complete visions. Artists do studies in their preparation to do a painting. They do a number of sketches of the complete composition as well as work at various possibilities for the individual characters making up the composition. Picasso worked for a month and a half producing compositional and char- acter studies for his mural Guernica. We have a record of these studies and they reveal how his thinking changed over his time preparing to do the mural.24 To me, this is evidence that Picasso did not have a one-time complete vision. The compositional and character aspects of the painting were developed slowly over a significant period of time. More generally, impor- tant ideas tend to be crafted over a long period of time. For example, Charles Darwin worked his entire adult professional life developing his ideas about evolution. Let’s return to our engineer sketching. How does he or she actually sketch in the face of limited WM? I see it as a dynamic process, a back and forth with the page until the engineer got to what he or she judged to be a suitable sketch. My second point of departure with Ferguson is his ideas on scientific thinking versus verbal thinking versus nonverbal thinking. It’s clear that he thought these were different kinds of thinking. I don’t think they are. As I see it, they’re all the same. Let me explain. When I make an argument, I use my LTM, WM, and the page in front of me to record the argument as I go. It’s a dynamic process that involves me processing in my WM employing the content of my LTM and the content of the page in front of me. Whether I decide to sketch a flywheel or write some mathematics or words, it’s all the same. It’s a meaningful translation of what I want to extract from my LTM and WM at the time. I then observe the new whole on the page (the “message”) and decide how to adjust it. The point is that an exographic is an exographic. So, if I’m thinking through the design of a mechanical gadget, then I’ll make a series of sketches. If I’m trying to figure out the mechanical advantage of a pulley system, I’ll use a diagram and some mathematics. If I’m writing a novel, I’ll use words. The type of objects I choose to put on a page will 23 Eugene Ferguson, “The Mind’s Eye: Nonverbal Thought in Technology,” Science 197, no. 4306 (1977). 24 The information is drawn from: Robert Weisberg, “On Structure in the Creative Process: A Quantitative Case-Study of Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 45 the Creation of Picasso’s Guernica,” Empirical Studies of the Arts 22, no. 1 (2004). 46 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas depend on the problem I’m trying to solve. In his studies for Guernica, Picasso didn’t use words to plan the bull in the top left-hand corner. He sketched it. All of what we put on the page is cognitively the same—it’s the symbols we think we need to push the idea forward. When one of my students is unsatisfied with the way a question was marked on an exam, he or she will discuss the grade with me. Most of the time, students want more credit for a highly disorganized answer. When they are uncertain about the answer at the time of the exam’s writing, they’ll do a memory dump of all the points they think might be relevant, usu- ally at random locations on the page. Then they’ll point to one or two pieces of this dump in the post-exam discussion with me once they know what the correct answer is, often saying “But, sir, you know what I meant!” It’s their view that the argument was clear in their heads but they had difficulty putting it on paper. My experience is quite different. As I bring an idea to the surface, the thoughts in my head are quite muddled. I have to use the page to clarify my thinking. In fact, the clearest version is always on the page and not in my mind. Given my limited WM, there is no way I could have a clearer argument in my mind. Needless to say, this line of student appeal no longer works with me. 2.10 The Ideasphere and Its Partition Millions of years ago, our ancestor species were knapping stone to make tools, and, as time passed, they made more sophisticated tools. Since that time, we’ve learned how to control fire, how to cook, we invented agriculture and its associated tools and implements, learned metallurgy and how to fashion metal tools and especially weapons, we invented yarn and textiles, and made clothes. We’ve done some impressive ideation and none of it required writing. In the context of ideating an artifact, at all steps in the innovation process, the incomplete gadget is persistent in the innovator’s field of view and with eyesight, hands, and imagina- tion, the finished gadget eventually comes to life. We’ve had a long history of working with objects in our visual frame. It’s clear that the imaginations of our ancient ancestors were able to make the connection between their actions to reshape a rock and what that altered rock could do for them when it came to butchering a carcass. Coming back to the idea of reification, I argued that exographics give us a way of bring- ing abstract concepts into our visual field where we have a long experience of manipulat- ing objects. Working on ideas with exographics requires the same process as with visible objects except that the things we work on with our hands are exographics on a page. These exographics on the page are no less real than the materials and tools we use to build concrete gadgets. So some ideas require exographics to discover and others don’t. Let’s now explore why. I’ve chosen the idea as my fundamental unit of analysis. The word “idea” comes from the Greek work “ɩ’δɛˈα” which means “form” or “pattern” and the Greek verb “ɩ’δɛı̃ν” which means “to see.” Ideas and vision seem to go hand in hand. We have a long history of using our imaginations and hands to manipulate objects in our visual field. It’s a familiar and very comfortable medium for human ideation. Ideas are intimately related to culture. One of the characteristics of our species is that we’re extraordinarily good at culture. One way to define culture is with our lifeways (beliefs, customs, knowledge, ideas, behaviors, institutions, laws, dress, architecture, art, etc.) But each of these cultural objects begins with an idea. We first have to imagine a cultural object; and then we take action to attempt to make it a cultural object. Hence, we could think of our accumulated culture as equivalent to a set of ideas. And let’s think broadly about this set. Let’s consider all world cultures and all the ideas that have given rise to those cultures. It includes the Moonblood creation myth of the Yanomami (a people who inhabit the Amazon rainforest), Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selec- tion, bicycles, pastrami, and baseball. As I suggested in Chapter 1, I’ll refer to the complete set of ideas as the Ideasphere.25 It’s worth noting that there are some remarkably good books on ideas. One is Daniel Boorstin’s The Discoverers; another is Ideas by Peter Watson.26 Still another good source is A History of Technology by Trevor Singer et al.27 There is a dependence structure within the Ideasphere. Some ideas require that we solve a number of other problems first and these solutions are also ideas. For example, let’s con- sider our idea of going to the moon and a related idea. On the return trip to earth, there is the small problem of entering the earth’s atmosphere at high speed. Just as meteors burn up, the Apollo 11 Command Module (CM) would have had it not been for its heat shield. The re-entry speed of the CM was about 17,500 miles per hour or about 5 miles per second. Most of us have experienced the force of the air when you put your arm out the window of a mov- ing car. Imagine what that force would be at a speed of 5 miles per second. Apparently, it’s enough to raise the underside of the CM to about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The process to put the heat shield in place was complicated.28 One of the critical parts was to inject each of 370,000 honeycomb shaped cylinders with a special compound. For this task, technologists called gunners used a special injection machine. The inspection and quality control process to make sure every cell was filled properly was extensive. All in, the number of problems that needed to be solved to put this part of the heat shield in place was enormous. For example, 25 The inspiration for the Ideasphere comes from the anthropologist Wade Davis and his conception of the Ethnosphere which he defines to be “the sum total of all the [human] thoughts, dreams, ideals, myths, intuitions, and inspirations brought into being by the imagination since the dawn of consciousness.” See his paper “Keynote Speech: The Ethnosphere and the Academy,” available at: https://www. wheretherebedragons. com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ DavisEthnosphereAcademy. pdf. 26 See Daniel Boorstin, The Discovers (New York: Random House, 1983) and Peter Watson, Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud (London: Orion Books, 2006). 27 Trevor Singer, E. J. Holmyard, Alfred Hall, Trevor Williams, A History of Technology (five volumes) (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1954). 28 See the YouTube video https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=64UM3CUqSfg. Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 47 48 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas what properties did the material injected into the honeycombs have to have? Why the hon- eycomb design? And why 370,000 honeycombs? The list is endless. That’s just for the heat shield! Going to the moon was an idea that required us to have a significant number of addi- tional ideas. The point is that there is a dependence structure within the Ideasphere, one I will make clear in Chapter 4. To add to the Ideasphere, we allow our imaginations to contemplate our experience and knowledge. As the examples above illustrate, sometimes we have to use exographics to help our imaginations access those ideas. While we need exographics to access certain kinds of ideas, we certainly didn’t need it to invent candles, coffee, and cities. This leads naturally to a partition of the Ideasphere into those ideas that require exographics to discover (the A Class, where the A stands for “Abstract”) and those that don’t (the C Class where C is for “Concrete”). I will also refer to the A Class as simply “The Abstract.” As I will argue in the next two chapters, the A Class is a vast expanse of ideas which has tended to grow exponentially over the last five centuries. It includes all of the knowledge we’ve generated at universities in the various disciplines and also a substantial proportion of our material culture including computers, smart-phones, cars, and aircraft. 2.11 Catching Unicorns Let’s summarize. We’ve evolved two remarkable intelligences. One is a powerful imagination, one that enables us to think about alternative futures and then, with our hands, try to make one of them happen. The other intelligence is our collaborative intelligence. We now depend on one another almost completely. Not surprisingly these intelligences resulted in the cultural artifact of language, and more recently, we’ve developed an exographic skill. Both language and exographics rely on our remarkable symbolic ability, this skill we have to associate an idea with sound (language) and/or drawings (exographics). With our collaborative skill, we’ve managed to agree on and share an astonishing symbol set and ways of stringing these symbols into ideas. More particularly, we’ve been able to imagine concepts/ideas that don’t exist in the real world. Not only that, we’re able to bring those abstract concepts/ideas into the concrete real-world with our exographics skill. As we have seen, this exographic skill enables us to extend our WMs to hatch some very complex ideas. This, then, is one of the great values of exographing it allows us to take full advantage of our imaginations and discover ideas that we otherwise couldn’t. It’s why I’ve titled the book as I have: exographics gives us a way of capturing the unicorns our minds can produce.","length":65152,"tokens":15117,"chunks":[{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"The power of the unaided mind is highly overrated.

From there, I’ll define the Ideasphere, the collection of all the ideas we’ve had since the beginning of human consciousness.

For instance, linguists think of a “writing system” as one whose defining purpose is the representation of speech. The technical term for such writing is glottographic writing. Writing also means producing a text like a novel. For primary schoolers, it means practicing their printing.

Another is TEXT as defined by Elaine Treharne and Claude Willan.3 Karl Lashley defined an engram to be a memory record stored inside the human nervous system.4 For example, our long-term memory record “2+3=5” is an engram.

An exographic is a set of persistent meaningful symbols (words, pictures, graphs, etc.) stored on a visible medium usually for the purpose of ideation. Exographing is the act of inscribing these representations on the medium. So an exographic could be glottographic or semasiographic writing and you can think of exographing as the writing you do to produce exographics.

Contrast that to the content of speech which “disappears” almost as quickly as it is spoken. Speech is ephemeral.

Roman Jakobson was the first to emphasize the importance of persistence.6 Certainly some scholars did not seem to understand the nature of exographics being persistent. For example, Eric Havelock wrote this: “The eye can review, that is, retrospect: the ear and mouth cannot.”7 As the example of movie subtitles makes clear, the eye cannot always review visual text. Hence persistence is not inherent in our cognitive skill set but rather it is a char- acteristic: of the medium we choose to present the symbols.

We basically studied what every offensive player did on every play. To figure out, say, what the left tackle was doing on a play, we would roll the video-tape over and over, sometimes in slow-motion. The beauty of the tape is that the play becomes persistent. What might have taken 6 seconds in real time, takes about 10–15 minutes to analyze by running and re-running the tape.

Whether it’s a his- tory essay, a book review for an English class, a mathematics assignment, or a chemistry lab report, your instructors have asked you to compose a finished exographic that is coherent and well written. Very often, the requirement is to write sentences and paragraphs. As you no doubt appreciate, this is a difficult skill to acquire. It takes a lot of practice to be able to produce good prose.

Writing a decent sentence is an exercise in logic.

In one sense, this is a good sentence because I understand the idea the student is trying to convey. But in another, it’s not. There is no need for the words “reading” and “of people” since autobiographies are always read and are always about people. As it turned out, the student meant “biographies” rather than “autobiographies.” Hence, the sentence could have been written: I enjoy biographies. which is the same idea as the original with half the words.","content_length":811,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"Basically, you need to look at any sentence you’ve written and make two assessments: Does this sentence convey the idea I intended? and Is there a way to write it with fewer words?

I find this fascinating: my mind can easily conclude that a given sen- tence doesn’t express what I want to convey but, at the same time, I sometimes have no idea how to fix it. This is the hard part of writing. As for the second question, the more you prac- tice, the better you will get at changing the words so that fewer are required. For example, rather than “at this point in time,” you could write “now.” I’ll not have much to say about finished exographics as there are many good books available on how to write well.","content_length":823,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"2.2 Ideation Technics Exographics are two-dimensional visual representations that help us to discover ideas. But as the literature on embodied thinking makes clear, we use many kinds of artifacts in the environment to help us think. When an artifact is a part of the process to help us think, I’m going to refer to it as an ideation technic. An exographic is a special case of ideation technic. Another example is an electronic calculator. Still another is Computer Aided Design (CAD), the software codes that allow engineers and architects to do design work much more quickly than if they were doing it by hand.

He then suspended weights from strings hanging down from the board. Here is a picture of the hanging chain model for the Sagrada Familia: Once the model was constructed, he took pictures of it and then turned the pictures upside down to see what it would look like.

Matthew Bourne’s Approach to Choreography Choreographers work in remarkably similar says to music composers. Matthew Bourne, the celebrated British choreographer, will experiment with dancers over a two-week period. At his direction, he films perhaps a hundred phrases and snippets with the dancers sometimes making suggestions to Bourne as the experiment proceeds. Then, with this collection of video clips, he “connects” them into a larger piece. He does live experiments along the way to see what a combination of these snippets looks like.

It can get pretty cold in the winter so sometimes I like to take an imaginary trip to a warmer place. Most of the time it’s to Paris. In my mind’s eye, it’s a late Sunday morning in early May, the sun is shining, and it’s unseasonably warm. My wife and I have just walked from our apartment in the Marais to the Bastille and we’re seated at an outdoor bistro surrounded by Parisians and other visi- tors who’ve also been drawn out by a perfect day.","content_length":734,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"We sit and chat idly, taking in the sun, the warmth, and the people.

In fact, the distinguishing feature of our species is how we process information. As nearly as we can tell, we’re the only species who can imagine different worlds on demand and then communicate the details of those worlds to others. Newton imagined a phantasm called gravity, his concept for the glue that holds the uni- verse together. Shakespeare imagined the tragic story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Our deep ancestors imagined that a useful tool could be had by chipping one stone with another. All of us can imagine alternative realities.","content_length":799,"content_tokens":170,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"For example, suppose you have an important one-on-one meeting with your superior in several day’s time about the new project you’ve been pushing.

Your superior will likely be going through the same sort of preparation. Imagination is a powerful skill. This book will focus on how we exploit our imaginations with exographics. We’ll begin by outlining two of our important skills in ideation supported by exographics: symbolic rep- resentation and abstraction. Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 33 2.4 Abstraction and Symbolic Representation Consider the following picture: It has three groups of objects.

Sometimes, I’ll want to distinguish a verbal symbol (I hear it) from an exographics symbol (I see it) In the case where I say the word balloon, I’ll use <balloon>v and when I write it, I’ll use <balloon>e. So what are symbols? They are purely arbitrary utterances or notations for the object we wish to refer to or represent. There is nothing about <balloon>v or <balloon>e that give any indication of the thing these symbols are referring to. They just happen to be the symbols we’ve agreed on. The second thing worth noting is that, over a life of experience, each of us has built up a significant common inventory of these symbols and they allow us to share our ideas a skill very important for collaboration.","content_length":794,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"Children are incredibly flexible in their use of symbols. For instance, a child might hold a small length of block so that one end is over his ear and the other is at his mouth. When he then speaks into the one end of the block close to his mouth, he is thinking of the block as a telephone. Maybe two minutes later, the boy will hold the block in his hand with it stretched above his head and then run around the room making a sound as though the block is an air- plane. One minute the block is a telephone; the next it’s an airplane. The block is symbolic. But it’s a different kind of symbolic. When this same child speaks the words of his native language, he is using symbols that his society has agreed on. At play, children are inventing their own symbols for referents. This is where we excel as a species. We’re really good with symbols.

Recently, researchers discovered a 44,000-year-old cave painting on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.10 In one of the paintings, there is a figure that appears to be a man with a beak and a tail. While it’s hard to know for sure what was going on in this ancient artist’s mind, this appears to be a case where the artist has substituted animal parts for their human counterparts. This is cer- tainly evidence of symbolic thinking. No doubt the artist had a model of a man and a model of a bird, each with all its component parts. The artist then imagined combining these two models to come up with the man/animal hybrid in the painting.","content_length":822,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"It’s an approach artists have used for some time. For example, the ancient Greeks invented minotaurs, sirens, satyrs, and many other composite human/animal forms. Let’s now come back to the group of three balloons. We can speak about four related objects: the symbol we speak, <balloon>v; the symbol we write, <balloon>e; the referent, the actual ontological object in the real world that we’re referring to with our symbols; and the concept (or meaning) of <balloon> we store in our minds. This stored concept will include a lot of information and knowledge of balloons that we’ve accumulated over time. Even though we think of this group as three balloons, there is a sense in which they are different. Each projects a different wavelength of reflected light and we use the symbol <colour> to refer to this characteristic.","content_length":824,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"There is a red balloon, a blue, and a gold. Colour is not like a cat or car because it doesn’t exist by itself in the real world. You can’t reach out and touch colour. In this case, it exists as a characteristic of a balloon. We refer to such concepts that have no concrete referent as an abstract concept. Let’s now look at all three groups in the picture. Even though these groups are of differ- ent objects (balloons, penguins, and cars), there is a sense in which each group is the same. If we count the number of objects in each group, we get the same number: three. Again, we can’t reach out and touch numberness, or, in this case, threeness. Hence, numberness and threeness are abstractions.","content_length":698,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"But we can reify the concept “threeness” with these symbols: <3>e, <three>v, <three>e, and <III>e. Let’s step back and think about the invention of language. About 3–4 million years ago, our ancestors were a small-headed ape, Australopithecus, and it’s clear from their skeletal remains, that they could not have had a voice box and the related parts that enable a modern human to speak. But at some point, between then and now, an ancestor species started to speak. Recall at the end of the first chapter that I suggested our most important cognitive skill was mind-sharing and collaboration. If there was a way to get to this wonderful idea of speech, we were the ape to do it. At the heart of speech is our ability to symbolize, to associate meaning with arbitrary physical movements (i.","content_length":790,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"e., ges- ture) and/or sounds. If speech wasn’t amazing enough, we then invented exographics about 5,000 years ago. Initially, these were short pictorial inscriptions of economic transactions. Over time, they 10 Maxime Aubert, Rustan Lebe, Agus Oktaviana, et al., “Earliest Hunting Scene in Prehistoric Art,” Nature 576 (2019): 442–445. bloomed into a full-blown representation of language. Again, by inscribing symbols on a medium, we’re able to communicate a meaning to a reader. The symbol <apple>e has a well understood meaning. As it turns out, much of our lexicon is abstract. <justice> is abstract and, by definition, does not have a corresponding physical reality.","content_length":671,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"How, then, would our ancestors who invented the word have come to a shared understanding of it? It had to have been that they discussed its meaning with words which had been previously defined, some of which could have been the representations of abstract ideas. Let’s make the example a little more understandable. How would we have come to the representation <three>? <three> is an abstract concept. As I explained above, there is no real- world referent for this concept. It’s a derivative concept in the sense that it’s a characteristic of a group of objects. As I’ll detail later in the book, it took us a long time to get to a stand-alone number three. There were a number of stages we went through before one of our ancestors realized that <three> could be a stand-alone idea. It was only after we invented exographics that we realized this.","content_length":848,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"In short, abstract ideas and their symbolic representations are difficult to discover. Thankfully, language and exographics extend our capability by enabling us to invent concepts and express ideas for which there is no corresponding physical reality. A good example of what I mean comes from the work of Andrew Wiles who managed to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, a problem in mathematics that had been open since Pierre de Fermat (1607–1665 CE) conjectured the theorem some 350 years ago. Wiles’s accomplish- ment is considered one of the great contributions to 20th-century mathematics. The proof itself is over 100 pages of dense mathematics.

For example, we can reify the idea of three using the symbol <3>e. More importantly, <3>e is just as concrete as an apple or a bear. 11 Andrew Wiles, “Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat’s Last Theorem,” Annals of Mathematics 141 (1995): 545.

The collective system of representations emerges over time as the unintended consequences of local goal-directed actions of individuals.12 By “collective system of representations” he means the representations that a particular culture arrives at and with “the unintended consequence of local goal-directed actions of individuals” he suggests that the underlying mechanism has an evolutionary flavour where an “environment” influences the optimizing choices of individuals.

Denise Schmandt-Besserat and others (more on this later) have suggested that the ancient Sumerians represented one unit of a particular good with a small token having a particular shape: For instance, small and large units of grain were counted with cones and spheres, oil with ovoids, animals with cylinders and the units of labor with tetrahedrons. Perhaps the single most archaic feature of the token system was to be used in one- to-one correspondence. Two jars of oil were shown by two ovoids and three jars of oil were marked by three ovoid tokens.14 So, initially, 23 units of labour would have been represented by 23 tetrahedrons.","content_length":902,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"Some cen- turies later, the ancient Babylonians represented the number 23 by making the following inscription on clay: 12 Geoffrey Saxe, with Indigo Esmonde, Cultural Development of Mathematical Ideas (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 3–4. 13 Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design (New York: Norton, 1987) 14 Denise Schmandt-Besserat, “Tokens and Writing: the Cognitive Development,” Scripta 1 (September 2009): 147. Left to right, the first two symbols represent 10s and these are followed by three 1s. That’s certainly more efficient that fashioning 23 ovoid tokens.

I envisioned the problem this way: 864 ×86 ££££ ££££ £££££ This is the standard approach to getting a product that I learned in primary school. My task was to fill in the boxes. The only thing allowed in my visual field were the numbers to be multiplied: 864 × 86. While there are now more complicated models, a simple model of our memory is that we have a Working Memory (WM) and a Long-Term Memory (LTM).15 Our WM is where we think and reason.

I would conclude the answer is 301. There are other ways to do this product (i. e., (40 × 7) + (3 × 7) = 301), but save for a few LTM calls, most of us could do the computation in our WMs easily. There is no need for exographics. Returning to the calculation of 864 × 86, I began by getting 864 × 6 = 5,184, the third row (the highest row of boxes) Then I went through the calculation of 864 × 8 to get the fourth row, 6,048.","content_length":680,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"But when I got the fourth row, I had forgotten the third row.

Eventually I decided 15 For more information on the structure of WM, readers are referred to Alan Baddeley’s compendium Working Memory, Thought, and Action (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007) Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 37 38 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas to “chunk” them. For example, for 864 × 6 = 5,184, I associated the names “Butkus/Moss.” These are NFL players: Dick Butkus wore the number 51 and Randy Moss wore 84.

Keep in mind that while I was doing these single digit additions, I had to also keep track of the final answer as I assembled it. The complete calculation took me about 40 minutes and most of this time was taken up with committing the third and fourth rows to my LTM.

Let’s look at some other arguments. Here’s a very small part of Aristotle’s Organon taken from “Prior Analytics”: First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. If no B is A, neither can any A be B. For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B.

But if some B is not A, there is no necessity that some of the As should not be B; e. g. let B stand for animal and A for man. Not every animal is a man; but every man is an animal. First note that it’s a sequence of statements. To make this clear, I’ll list the first three: Statement 1: First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. Statement 2: If no B is A, neither can any A be B. 18 Alexander Luria, The Mind of the Mnemonist (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987)","content_length":702,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 39 40 Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas Statement 3: For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B.

It is not until Chapter 38 that Gibbon gets to his thesis, that Rome crumbled from within: The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long.

Chapter 2 Exographics and Ideas 41 The complete six-volume argument is a sequence of statements with a logical thread connect- ing them into a whole. The General Structure of Arguments Let’s represent this structure with [S1, S2,   ., Sn, C] where S1, S2,   ., Sn is an ordered sequence of statements and C is the claim.

Clearly, as the argument gets more complex, and we have to keep more and more of this information in WM, we soon run into problem, much as I did trying to get an answer to the arithmetic problem above. Most ideas have a local independence property. What this means is that a thinker can focus on a small part of the idea pretty much to the exclusion of all other parts of the idea. For example, consider the argument justifying the solution of an equation in mathematics: 3x – 6 = 9. My first step would be to add 6 to both sides of the equation: 3x = 15. At this point, I can divide both sides by 3 to get the solution x = 5.","content_length":864,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"Note that, when I am doing the manipulation to get to the third equation, I only have to consider the second equation, 3x = 15.

In this way, I can focus on a small part of the problem and there is no need to worry about other statements in the derivation.

This is an argument we can easily make in our WMs. Full independence is not possible with some ideas.

Regardless of terminology, most abstract arguments tend to have this independence property and this makes their ideation easier. Another way to characterize this property is with the concept of bilevel control. For exam- ple, as a novelist works on the word-to-word details of the story in Chapter 10, he or she has in mind the “gist” of the story—where it has been and where it’s going. She has no memory record of exactly what’s been written in any of the previous chapters but she is aware of the story’s gist.

If you’re blind, exographics is not much use to you directly. So how did he do it? As it turns out, he used scribes (one a son) who were themselves good mathematicians. He would dictate to them, and they would write it down and check that Euler made the calculation cor- rectly. One thing you have going for you in mathematics is that, most of the time, you only have to carry the last step in your memory.

The Odys- sey is 12,000-plus lines and the Iliad is longer. Admittedly both epics are narratives and thus easier to memorize particularly with the oral-formulaic technique for retelling.

I’m just focussed on him thinking it through. Even if you’re able to get through the tedium of thinking through a complex abstract idea without exographics, what do you do with it when you’re done?

In the 19th century, in an age where Christian orthodoxy was that we were made by a Creator in his image and likeness, Dar- win offered a much different story. He suggested that all species were related (man to trees, flowers, and other animal species) Furthermore, he argued that we had built-in biological mechanisms that produced intra-species variation and only those most suited to the environ- ment they found themselves in would survive to reproduce and pass on their characteristics to the next generation.","content_length":824,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Ideas","content":"It’s a powerful idea, one that is now accepted by the vast majority of the scientific community.

Ancient Mesopotamian praise poem by King Lipit-Eshtar for Nisaba, Goddess of Scribal Wisdom In this chapter, I’ll argue this idea: P1: A sophisticated number system is required for quantitative measurement; and P2: Exographing is required to define and use a relatively sophisticated number system. Implication: Exographing is required for measurement. The history of exographing suggests that measurement and exchange accompany exographics. Certainly measurement is an embodied activity. Just measuring the length of a board requires you to use your hands to operate the tape measure and your eyes to read the exographics of the tape measure. Let’s consider statement P2. We currently use a placeholder number system and the arithmetic we do with it doesn’t have to be very complex before we require exographics to get answers. Imagine trying to calculate 62.3 × 4.59 + 634.1 × 26.0 without exographics (or equivalently a calculator or computer). Measurement, by its nature, requires numbers. During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon in 1970 an explosion caused a signficant loss in battery power in the Command and Service Module (CSM). The decision was made to shut down the CSM and have the crew move into the Lunar Module (LM). This required that the guidance data from the CSM system be transferred to the LM system. To do this, 49 50 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement the commander, James Lovell, had to make an arithmetic calculation by hand. We have a record of the calculation. Lovell used a pencil to transcribe CSM navigation data to a page of one of his manuals. He then followed this page’s algorithm to get the new navigation settings to input into the LM. This calculation had to be done correctly. Any error would have had catastrophic consequences. Lovell realized this and so asked Houston to check his calculations. Here is the actual conversation between the Apollo 13 crew and Mission Control in Houston: 058:04:03 CDR (LOVELL) Houston. Okay.

A lot of science, engineering, and know-how—some of it quite ancient in origin—went into the measurement, arithmetic, and exographics of that important moment in the flight of Apollo 13. 3.1 Society and the Cultural Need for Numbers We sometimes forget that there is a lot a child must learn about numbers. Children usually begin by learning the names of the integers without really knowing what each means. Then they learn meaning by practising with examples in their visual field. For example, a child might be shown a picture of 4 puppies and asked how many puppies are in the picture. When a child is ready to learn the arithmetic operations, often physical objects or “manipulatives” are used. For example, if a child is shown that one group has 3 marbles and another has 4 marbles, a teacher might then ask how many marbles there are altogether. Conceptually, the child would put the marbles into one group and then count them to get a total. In fact, when children are asked what 3 + 4 is, some will use their fingers to get the sum. What is clear is 5 2324 25 19 22 26 4321 6 7 8 12 1 Saxe and Esmonde, Cultural Development of Mathematical Ideas, 2012. Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 51 that children learn numbers, counting, and arithmetic with physical objects and exographics in their visual fields. Learning arithmetic is embodied effort. Anthropologists tell us that most indigenous societies have very simple number systems. In fact, some have only four number concepts: “none,” “1,” “2,” and “many.” Generally, these societies have yet to write down their language. What seems to be clear is that a society will only develop a more complicated number system when it’s needed. I’ll give examples of this in the following sections. The Oksapmin Number System The anthropologist Geoffrey Saxe has documented an interesting example of how culture influ- ences a society’s number system. He has studied the Oksapmin people of Papua New Guinea (PNG) extensively.1 These people inhabit the central mountainous area of PNG along with a number of neighbouring peoples. First contact with the West occurred in 1938 with the Hagen- Sepik Patrol (350 people) led by James Lewis and John Black. From this point on, Oksapmin trade with the outside world increased in intensity. The Oksapmin cultivated taro and sweet potato, kept pigs, hunted small game, and collected protein-rich insects and worms. In pre- contact days, there was a healthy trade with neighbouring peoples. Oksapmin communities traded for stone axes in the north, for black palm and bows in the south, and for salt in the east. The Oksapmin use a body-counting system where the first 27 integers correspond to the body locations as shown below: 14 13 11 910 15 16 1718 21 20 27 © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company. 52 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement The thumb of the right hand is assigned 1. The rest of the fingers of the right hand correspond to 2–5. Thereafter, the assignment proceeds around the body until the small finger of the left hand is assigned 27. The nose corresponds to the middle integer in this range, 14. A number is identified by either pointing to a body part or saying the body part’s name. With the arrival of the outside world, trade and intra-community exchange intensified. Saxe distinguishes three periods: Period 1 (1938–1962), Period 2 (1962–1982), and Period 3 (1982–2000). Within Period 1, the Australian pound and shilling were introduced. In the second period, an airstrip and school were established, the Oksapmin were taking jobs out- side their region, and towards the end of the period, Oksapmin entrepreneurs were estab- lishing trading posts. At the beginning of Period 3, the Ok Tedi mine was opened and this increased economic activity significantly. In addition, the Oksapmin were net exporters of vegetables. In the early 1990s, exported vegetables amounted to 3 metric tons and by 2002, had increased to 10–12 metric tons by some estimates. Saxe estimates that economic activity increased exponentially over the three periods. The use of money increased in intensity over the three periods and this created a new set of problems for the Oksapmin. First, they would have to adjust to the various values of the notes and coins. And second, they would have to become adept at the arithmetic associ- ated with exchange. If several items were purchased, addition is important to determine total value. Subtraction is also important since, for most transactions, change would have to be made. There is also a role for multiplication (a fast way of adding) in the case where a buyer purchased two or more units of the same item. Over the three periods, there were three currencies introduced. The first was the Aus- tralian pound in circulation to 1966. This was replaced by Australian dollars for the period 1966–1975. Finally, with the independence of PNG from Australia in 1975, the Australian dollar was replaced by the PNG currency (the kina, with 1 kina = 100 toea). What is clear is that, prior to all of this new economic activity, there was little need for arithmetic. But that changed as economic activity increased. What alerted Saxe to this was the use of a single word “fu.” Saxe’s first visit to the Oksapmin was in the late seventies. At that time, and after an Oksapmin person had counted from 1 to 27, he would exclaim “tit fu” indicating a complete enumeration of the body parts. In his 2001 visit to the Oksapmin, Saxe noticed the word “fu” being used in a different way. When used with a particular body part, its new meaning was to double the value of that body part. After making sure that he had interpreted the meaning correctly, Saxe realized that arithmetic had finally arrived and so he began to document its use. Here is an example Saxe documents of a shopkeeper doing some arithmetic using the body-counting system. The problem is to subtract 7 from 16. To do this, the shopkeeper begins by pointing to his left ear which is the body-part associated with 16. He then breaks 16 into two parts. He first points to his right shoulder indicating 10. Then, he points to his left wrist indicating 6. So now he has two numbers marked, 10 on his right side, and 6 on his left side. These clearly sum to 16, where he started. At this point he points to his right forearm Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 53 indicating 7. This leaves three numbers left on his right side: the 8 (elbow), the 9 (bicep), and the 10 (shoulder). He then transfers these three remaining numbers to his left-hand side. One gets transferred to the left forearm, another to the left elbow, and another to his left bicep. This makes a total of 9 (the original 6 on the left side and then the 3 numbers transferred) which he claims is the answer to his problem. Most of us would consider this to be a trivial problem. We can all do the calculation 16 − 7 = 9 easily. But the shopkeeper has internalized arithmetic and numbers in a different way. His calculation required reference to body parts. In Chapter 2, I presented the Saxe’s principle of how symbolic representations evolve: “A central thesis is that the collective system of representations emerges over time as the unintended consequences of local goal-directed actions of individuals.”2 I think there is a sense in which this principle also applies to how culture progresses. We are not who we are by grand design but by a process of local incremental improvement. More importantly for my argument, the Oksapmin had to get their number system into their visual field and they did so with their body-counting system. Effectively the body-counting system is the three- dimensional equivalent to our two-dimensional exographics system of number representation and manipulation. The Street Kids of Recife Terezinha Carraher et al. document an interesting case of child street vendors in Recife, a city of 1.5 million on the north-eastern coast of Brazil.3 Typically, the parents of these chil- dren are the street vendors, but the children help out and sometimes have to handle transac- tions themselves. The subjects were five children ranging in age from nine to fifteen with varying levels of education and coming from very poor economic backgrounds. The researchers approached these children in their street vendor settings and engaged them in some hypothetical transactions. Here is an example: Customer: How much is one coconut? M (a subject): 35 Customer: I’d like ten. How much is that? M: (Pause) Three will be 105; with three more that will be 210. (Pause) I need four more. That is . . . (pause) 315 . . . I think it is 350.4 We would solve this problem 35 × 10 = 350. The child solves it in a series of steps as follows: (35 × 3) + (35 × 3) + (35 × 3) + 35 = 350. 2 Saxe and Esmonde, Cultural Development of Mathematical Ideas, 3–4. 3 Terezinha Carraher, David Carraher, and Analucia Schliemann, “Mathematics in the Streets and the Schools,” British Journal of Developmental Psychology 3, (1985): 21–29. 4 Carraher, et al., “Mathematics in the Streets,” 23. 54 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement Subsequent to these street interactions, the researchers engaged these children in a for- mal test usually at the child’s home. The problems given the children were based on the initial interaction with the child. Here are examples one and two from the paper (page 26): (1) First example (M, 12 years) Informal Test Customer: I’m going to take four coconuts. How much is that? Child:Threewillbe105,plus30,that’s135... onecoconutis35... thatis...140! Formal Test Child solves the item 35 × 4 explaining out loud: 4 times 5 is 20, carry the 2; 2 plus 3 is five, times 4 is 20. Answer written: 200 (2) Second example (MD, 9 years) Informal Test Customer: OK, I’ll take three coconuts (at the price of Cr$ 40.00 each). How much is that? Child: (Without gestures, calculates out loud) 40, 80, 120. Formal Test Child solves the item 40 × 3 and obtains 70. She then explains the procedure ‘Lower the zero; 4 and 3 is 7.’ The children answered 98.2% of the sixty-three informal test problems correctly but only 73.7% of the formal test problems. Again, I take Saxe’s principle to apply. In the street vend- ing milieu, it is important for the children to get the correct answer and they do. They had developed ways to do the arithmetic accurately and they clearly did this a different way than what they were taught in school. 3.2 The Invention of Exographics in Sumeria Subsequent to the Agricultural Revolution (roughly 10,000 BCE), small settlements developed along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers over the Ubaid Period (6500–3800 BCE). Uruk was the first of these settlements to come to prominence. By 3,200 BCE, its population was estimated to be 40,000 people. Today the location of Uruk is stark desert. But back then, it was fertile farmland close to the Euphrates with plenty of wetlands and grassy areas for grazing. Basically, the region offered little natural resource other than water, clay, reeds, and date-palms. In fact, the rainfall was not sufficient to grow crops so the Sumerians built and maintained an irrigation canal network. With Uruk at its peak, the Sumerians mass produced textiles and pottery and traded with other Mesopotamian settlements for what they needed. What is clear is that Uruk was able to generate a considerable economic surplus largely from the fields and trade. This, in turn, allowed them to undertake massive public projects like the many large temples in the Eannu district. Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 55 Their society was socially stratified with a ruling class, high priests and temple admin- istrators, tradespeople, a military class, a lower freeman class, and then a slave class. Labour was differentiated which made for lots of specialization. The Sumerians were the first to live in large urban settlements with all of the attendant organizational problems. One was managing economic exchange. Not surprisingly, it is in this area where we start to see the cultural tools which ultimately morph into exographics. Let’s now have a look at how this happened. We don’t know the full story but we know enough to say that exographics grew out of the administrative need to manage the economic surplus. Seals and Tokens “Tokens” in large masses were discovered at archaeological sites across Mesopotamia over several millennia beginning in the Ubaid Period (6500–3800 BCE). Here is a picture of some of the tokens discovered at Tello, ancient Girsu, Iraq, dated to 3300 BCE:5 Denise Schmandt-Besserat, an expert on the use of these tokens in the administration of these ancient settlements, has suggested that the tokens in the top row represent (left to right): one length of a particular textile; unknown; one unit of metal (silver?) and those in the bottom row represent (left to right): one ram; unknown; one measure of honey; one jar of oil. Some of the specifics of Schmandt-Besserat’s arguments have met with opposition.6 But archeologists generally agree that these tokens were counters of some kind. In addition to tokens, there is evidence that administrators used seal impressions pro- duced by specially made stamps and cylinders. These may have served a security purpose 5 Reproduced with the permission of Denise Schmandt-Besserat. 6 Interested readers are referred to these reviews of her work: Zimansky, Paul. 1993. “Review of Denise Schmandt-Besserat, Before Writing.” Journal of Field Archaeology 20: 513–517; Stephen Lieberman, “Of Clay Pebbles, Hollow Clay Balls, and Writing: A Sumerian View,” American Journal of Archaeology 84, no. 3 (1980); and Robert Englund, “Review of D.

Reprinted with permission. 56 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement as they would be used on the seals of jars and sometimes door locks. In time, it appears that they were used on clay tablets as a form of signature. These seal impressions are exographics. Bullae Archaeologists have also discovered that these tokens were sometimes packed into clay bul- lae or envelopes. Basically, a fresh clay ball was formed and then cut in half. Hardened tokens would then be packed into both halves of the soft clay. Subsequently, the two halves would be rejoined, shaped back into a ball, and left in the sun to bake and harden. It is likely that a bulla represented some sort of account. For example, it might have been for a particular farmer and the tokens specified the taxes the farmer owed. When the farmer came to the temple to settle, his bulla was broken open and its contents were compared with what the farmer was delivering. Hollow clay envelopes have been discovered with tokens inside and it would appear that these served the same purpose. At Nuzi (a settlement north of the city of Babylon), Leo Oppenheim discovered a hollowed-out egg-shaped clay tablet with cuneiform writing on the outside.7 The writing translated to this list of 49 items: 21 ewes that lamb 6 female lambs 8 full grown male sheep 4 male lambs 6 she-goats that kid 1 he-goat 3 female kids When this bulla was opened, a total of 49 tokens of various shapes were found. Schmandt- Besserat reports that, in the same place, Oppenheim found other cuneiform tablets which had accounting notes, statements like these:8 “These sheep are with PN; the stones have not been deposited” “Three lambs, two young he-goats, the share of PN, they are charged to his account . . . [but] not deposited among the stones” “One ewe belonging to PN, its stone has not been removed” But other researchers have suggested that this example is not definitive. For example, Kris- tina Sauer reports that of the 200 hollow envelopes discovered to date, only 18 have writing on the outside and the contents of only 14 of these are known. Significantly, not all have a correspondence between what’s inside and what’s noted on the outside.9 7 Leo Oppenheim, “On an Operational Device in Mesopotamian Bureaucracy,” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 18 (1959): 121–128. 8 These statements are taken from Denise Schmandt-Besserat’s book Before Writing: From Counting to Cuneiform (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1992), 9. 9 Kristina Sauer, “From Counting to Writing: The Innovative Potential of Bookkeeping in Uruk Period Mesopotamia,” in Appropriating Innovations: Engtangled Knowledge in Eurasia, 5000–1500 BCE, eds. Philipp Stockhammer and Joseph Maran (Oxford: Oxbow, 2017). Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 57 Pierre Amiet offered supporting evidence on the bulla.10 He discovered them at Susa and these date to 2,000 years before Oppenheim’s egg-shaped bulla. He suggested that the tokens were counters for various commodities. Amiet was the first to venture the connection of tokens to accounting for commodities. Eventually, rather than breaking open a bulla each time there was a settlement, the administrators made impressions on the outside of it when it was initially formed designating what was inside. Effectively, the administrators went from a three-dimensional object (the bulla and tokens within) to a representation of the tokens imprinted on the two-dimensional surface of the bulla. This innovation is significant because it paves the way for a system where the account is stated on just a rectangular clay tablet and, in fact, this is what happened next. In the literature, these clay tablets are referred to as numeric tablets. Numeric-ideographic Tablets As reported by Hans Nissen, Peter Damerow, and Robert Englund, administrators eventually moved to clay tablets where the name of the commodity and the amount of the commodity were specified.11 Here is an example of a tablet specifying food rations: The two rows of three circular impressions and those below them represent amounts. The significance of these numeric-ideographic tablets is that we are now only a short cognitive step away from representing language. Certainly, these are exographics in every sense of the definition. They represent a fully formed idea on a two-dimensional permanent medium. 10 Pierre Amiet, “Il y a 5000 ans les Elamites inventaient l’ecriture,” Archeologia 12 (1966). 11 Nissen, Hans, Peter Damerow, and Robert Englund, Archaic Bookkeeping: Early Writing and Techniques of Economic Administration in the Ancient Near East. trans. P. Larsen (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993). Adam Jan Figel 58 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement The Cognitive Difficulting of Inventing Stand Alone Numbers When we first started to think about numbers, it is likely that they were tied to the object being counted. The great anthropologist, Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, reported that the Heiltsuk of central British Columbia fused the idea of number and the object being counted into a single representation.12 For example, their word for “one empty box” is “menskam”; for “two empty boxes,” “masem”; and for “three empty boxes,” “yutkusem.” Whereas, the three words for “one day,” “two days,” and “three days,” are, respectively, “op’enequls,” “matlp’enequls,” and “yutqp’enequls.” So cognitively, it was not natural to separate the idea of the number from the object being counted. On this point, Bertrand Russell said this: It is only at a high stage of civilization that we could take this series [the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, ...] as our starting-point. It must have required many ages to discover that a brace of pheasants and a couple of days were both instances of the number 2: the degree of abstraction involved is far from easy.13 There is evidence for Russell’s claim based on studies of societies with anumeric lan- guages (languages with just a few number concepts). The Pirahã, a people inhabiting the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, have only two numeric words. One is “few” and the other is “many.” They do not have a word for the number 1 or any other integer. The anthropologist Peter Gordon did some remarkable experiments where he asked Pirahã subjects to match a line of AA batteries placed on a table.14 For example, if Gordon lined up six batteries, the subjects were required to match the same line of six batteries. Subjects had no trouble if the number of batteries was 3 or fewer. But if the number was 4 or more, they began to make errors, and their frequency of error increased, the higher the number. After Gordon published his study, a number of other researchers looked at Pirahã numerosity and none have experi- mental evidence which weakens Gordon’s findings. This is strong evidence that numbers are a cultural artifact and that quantity recognition for numbers 4 or higher is intimately tied to the linguistic names we give these numbers. Let’s examine the representational efficiency of separating the number from the article being counted. Suppose I need to keep track of 5 units of a good. One representation requires that I use five symbols (tokens), one for each unit. But if the representation of the number is separated, I only need two symbols, one for the number and the second for the type of thing being counted. This is a significant improvement in representational efficiency. The same information is stored with fewer symbols. But cognitively, it comes at the cost of developing linguistic names for the numbers. The Transition to Cuneiform Eventually, this accounting technology led to etching other kinds of symbols on the tab- lets, symbols that represented real-world objects. These initial symbols constituted a kind of 12 Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, How Natives Think (New York: Knopf, 1910 (in English 1926)). 13 Bertrand Russell, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy (London, George Allen & Unwin, 1919), 3. 14 Peter Gordon, “Numerical Cognition Without Words: Evidence from Amazonia,” Science 306, no. 5695 (2004), 469–499. star sun month man king son head Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 59 writing referred to as pictographic writing because they were actually crude pictures of what was being represented. If I were thinking of representing a real-world object as a symbol, I’m quite sure my first choice would be with a picture of the object. The following table shows proto-cuneiform symbols in column 2 with the title “Sumerian (Vertical)”; subsequent col- umns show how the symbols changed over time. The last column is cuneiform. SUMERIAN (Vertical) SUMERIAN (Rotated) EARLY LATE From the last column, you can see that the symbols look less pictographic. As in most repre- sentation, symbols seem to transition to forms that are less iconic over time. Synthesis There are two important points to make. It seems to me that Geoffrey Saxe’s principle of ide- ation and Edwin Hutchins’s “cognition in the wild” are both at play here. Saxe suggested that the “collective system of representations emerges over time as the unintended consequences of local goal-directed actions of individuals.” Hutchins emphasized that cognition was cul- tural and driven by material artifacts. Over a time period measured in millennia, cuneiform writing emerged out of series of incremental changes to representations. In the end, we find that administrative necessity on the part of the state resulted in a series of exographics models that lead to the full-blown writing of language. 3.3 The Ubiquity of Measurement What don’t we measure? There’s the economy (prices, quantities, GDP, income, inequal- ity, tax, demand, supply . . . the list is huge). There’s science (time, distance, speed, accel- eration, density, volume, and again the list is just about limitless). There’s engineering (the engineers definitely measure everything . . . their list might be the largest). There’s sport (scores, athlete measures like height, weight, goals, assists, touchdown passes, interceptions, etc.). There’s medicine (temperature, blood pressure, measurement of various concentrations BABYLONIAN BABYLONIAN ASSYRIAN Mason, William Albert, Cuneiform evolution from archaic script (1855–1923). 60 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement of compounds in the blood, risk of a heart attack and stroke, life expectancy, etc.). There’s politics (number of votes, demographic measures, poll results, etc.). There’s war (number of casualties, number of troops available, number of tanks, fighter aircraft, ICBM warheads, submarines, and so on . . .). If we were to sit down and make a list of everything we measured, it would take us a long time to assemble it. For instance, take time. One of its more important uses is the coordination of activity in a modern society. Just looking at my schedule, I have a Zoom call tonight at 8 pm. Tomorrow I have a medical appointment at 9:20 am and I am to give a lecture beginning at 11 am and ending at 11:50 am. I am to meet colleagues for lunch this Friday at noon. Christmas is in 31 days. Golf season will begin again likely in early April. The list is endless. Or consider measurement and the basic organization of a book, say a textbook like this one. Its pages are numbered. It has two important internal maps: the Table of Contents and the Index. If I want to look at a particular general topic, I can turn to the Table of Contents and quickly peruse it to see what chapter I should go to. On the other hand, if I am interested in a narrower topic, I might turn to the Index. So as long as I know the ordering of numbers and the ordering of the letters of the alphabet, I can readily navigate the book. The history of measurement is interesting. A part of the story is our efforts to standardize measurements. The metre is currently defined as the length travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. It used to be that we used a lot of anthropomorphic measures. For instance, a “hand” was the breadth of a closed human hand (including the thumb). In many countries, the height of a horse was (and still is) measured in hands. Today, we playfully mea- sure the amount of alcohol in a drink using the term “fingers” where one finger is defined to be the width of a finger. So if the alcohol in a drink comes up to three fingers as the hand wraps around a glass, that’s three fingers. Our intensity of measurement seems to be accelerating. The new science of data ana- lytics and quants seem to be invading all of our endeavours. For example, a KLOC is the amount of work required to write 1,000 lines of computer code. 3.4 Orville and Wilbur Wright I’ll do a number of detailed case studies of how we got to important ideas. The first of these will concern Orville and Wilbur Wright who figured out the principles for the control of powered flight. It’s a great story, one of perseverance and passion to solve a difficult problem. While they did some clever thinking along the way, what is clear is that they could not have done it without exographics, a number system, and measurement. You might find this section difficult to read because of its technical content but the detail of this content is not really the point. I am simply trying to convey that the Wright brothers required strong imaginations, technical know-how, measurement, and exographics to accom- plish what they did. As you read this section, make note of the measurements done and the exographics which support those measurements. Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 61 Orville and Wilbur Wright (1871–1948 and 1867–1912 CE, respectively) stood on some very big shoulders. Sir George Cayley (1773–1857 CE) made a number of important discov- eries including identifying the four forces acting on a fixed-wing aircraft (drag, thrust, lift, weight) and the importance of the shape of the wings. He was also the first to think about an airplane as a fuselage with fixed wings. Before him, the idea was that wings had to move, much like a bird moves its wings. Other contributors included William Henson, Jean-Marie le Bris, Alphonse Penaud, and Otto Lilienthal who died in a gliding accident in 1896. Lilien- thal’s death may have left the deepest impression on the Wrights. Their program of research had them flying close to the ground to avoid catastrophic accidents. They did have crashes but none serious enough to do permanent damage. By the time the Wrights started their work, a lot was known about fixed-wing flight. What was not well understood was how to control an aircraft in flight. Neither brother finished high school so they didn’t have the benefit of an advanced engi- neering education. What they did have was remarkable mechanical ability and extraordinary energy and curiosity. They discovered the principles of powered flight using the standard scientific approach of trial and observation. At the time, a hallmark of those who worked on flight was to redesign from scratch when an existing design failed. Not so with the Wrights. They developed an understanding of the theory and principles of flight as they went and let this theory guide their next steps. I’ll first explain the basic principles of fixed-wing powered flight and then describe how the Wrights came to these principles. The Principles of Fixed-Wing Powered Flight To fly, two problems need to be solved. First you have to get the machine into the air, and, once it’s in the air, you have to be able to control its movement. Let’s first look at the problem of getting into the air. The Airbus A380 is presently the largest passenger aircraft in the world. It can accommodate up to 850 passengers and its takeoff weight is approximatly 575,000 kgs. It’s hard to believe that this behemoth can get off the ground. How is it done? If an aircraft is to fly, the four forces acting on it have to be in balance. One force is gravity which points down and acts to keep the aircraft on the ground. Basically, it’s the weight of the aircraft. Another is the force of the air on the aircraft as it moves through the air. This force is called drag and it points in the direction opposite the aircraft’s direction of flight. You can think of drag as the oncoming “wall” of air that opposes the aircraft’s movement forward. To overcome these two forces, there are two additional forces, thrust and lift. In the case of the A380, the jet engines provide thrust which causes the aircraft to move forward. What gets it into the air is lift, a force that is generated by the combination of thrust and the shape of the aircraft’s wings. I’ll illustrate with a couple of simple experiments. Imagine you’re in a speeding car. You put your hand out the window with palm flat to the horizontal with fingers together and pointing in the direction of movement. The force acting on your hand 62 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement is minimal. Now imagine bending your hand at the wrist so your fingers move up slightly, perhaps a couple of inches, revealing your palm to the oncoming wind. This wind exerts a lift force on the underside of your hand; you can feel it because your hand wants to move further up. Keep in mind what is going on here. It’s the thrust which causes the aircraft to go through the air creating the wind and therefore the force. Now imagine that, from the horizontal position, you move your fingers down. As you move them down, you feel the force of the oncoming wind on back of your hand and, as a result, your hand wants to move further down. From this, we see that if a moving aircraft’s wings are inclined slightly up so that the oncoming air hits the underside of the wing surface, then a lift force will be generated. But that’s not the complete story of lift. Cut a rectangular strip of paper a couple inches wide and about a foot long. Hold the short side against your lower lip so that the long side sags down. Now blow air across the top of the surface of the paper. This causes the paper to lift into the air and, if you blow hard enough, it gets to a horizontal position. When you eventually stop blowing, the paper sags downward again. What is happening? Effectively you are blowing air away from the top surface of the paper. This causes air from below to want to fill that space and in the process an upward force—lift—is put on the paper. In aerodynamic terms, the blown air creates low-pressure air above the paper and the higher-pressure air from below then pushes up to try and fill the low-pressure space. So how do we get the air to move more quickly over the top of the wing of an aircraft cre- ating the dichotomy of pressures necessary for lift? It turns out we can do it with the wing’s airfoil, its cross-sectional shape. If the bottom of the wing is relatively flat and the top of the wing is humped (or “cambered”), the movement of air across the wing, from leading edge to trailing edge, will create the differential pressure and lift. Now to control. The first concept to understand is the aircraft’s center of gravity. This is a point approximately halfway down the fuselage where the aircraft would exactly balance if you were to support it underneath only at this point. To see how the aircraft can change direction, I’ll begin by defining three axes and then the movement of the aircraft about those axes. Once I do that, I’ll describe what control sur- faces are employed to affect each movement. We could think of a lateral axis running parallel to the wings (perpendicular to the fuselage) and going through the center of gravity. If the aircraft changes its pitch, the nose will go up or down depending on what the pilot wants to do. If the nose goes up, the back of the fuselage will move down, thus beginning a rotation around the lateral axis. Now consider a vertical axis going through the center of gravity. If the pilot affects a movement where the nose of the aircraft goes left, then the back of the aircraft will go right to affect the rotation around the vertical axis. This movement of the aircraft around the verti- cal axis is called yaw. Finally, imagine an axis running the length of the fuselage and through the center of gravity. Rotation of the fuselage around this axis is called roll. When an aircraft rolls, one wing will go up and the other will go down. Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 63 Each movement described above (pitch, yaw, and roll) is associated with one of the air- craft’s three primary flight control surfaces, shown in the figure at the bottom of the page. The ailerons are the flaps on the trailing edge of each wing. In their resting position, they conform to the airfoil of the wing. They can either be turned up or down and when one is turned up, the other must be turned down. The ailerons always move in the opposite direc- tion. Their purpose is to cause the aircraft to roll (rotate around its longitudinal axis). When a pilot wishes to roll to the left (i. e., the left wing is down and the right wing is up), the aileron on the left wing is turned up and the one on the right wing is turned down. Aircraft have short horizontal fins attached at the rear of the fuselage. They look like stubby wings. These are called horizontal stabilizers and the elevators are the flaps attached to the trailing edge of these stabilizers. Like the ailerons, they conform to the shape of the stabilizers when not engaged. But when engaged, they move either up or down together. If they are turned up, the nose of the plane turns up. Similarly, if they are turned down, the nose of the plane turns down. The final control surface is the rudder. All aircraft have a vertical fin, the vertical stabi- lizer, coming out of the rear of the fuselage. The rudder is the flap attached to the rear end of the vertical stabilizer and it either turns left or right. If it turns to the left, the nose moves left and if it turns to the right, the nose moves right. In modern aircraft, there are a collection of secondary surfaces that refine its movement but, for the purposes of understanding the significance of what the Wright brothers accom- plished, we only need to understand the primary surfaces. Let’s now go back to the work the Wrights did to discover these primary controls. The Wrights and Their Experimentation When the Wrights began their work on flight in 1899, they could only work at it part-time as they had a successful bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Basically, the late spring and summer were reserved for the bicycle shop and the rest of the year for their experiments and study of flight. Neither brother married so, without family obligations, they had time to pursue their inquiry. They were aware of Edison’s and Alexander Graham Bell’s inventions as well as the AC Drone 64 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement technological upheaval of the Industrial Revolution. It was certainly an age of technological discovery and they resolved to be a part of it. Both were young (in 1900, Wilbur was 33 and Orville, 29) and brought considerable energy to their endeavours. Both inherited a significant mechanical ability from their mother who did most of the upkeep around the family home. Their father was a clergyman, and by all accounts, had difficulty pounding a nail. Let’s now look at some of the details of their work over the critical period from 1899 to 1902.15 1899 Their first decision was to study gliding. They adopted the bi-wing design of Octave Chanute’s primarily because the box-like structure of the wings offered overall strength. Furthermore, they had decided that trying to control the flight of a glider by just “the shifting of the weight of their bodies” (as Lilienthal had done) was a mistake.16 Based on a close observation of birds, Wilbur thought that a gliding bird appeared to “warp” its wings (one wing tip would go up and the other down) in order to change direction. The brothers decided to try the same principle. Orville’s picture of such a warping is shown in below. Note that the warping was hand controlled from the ground. This warping was tested in July and it worked well. It had the same effect as modern ailerons causing the kite to roll and change direction. Towards the end of November, the brothers decided to build a bigger glider to test in 1900 and they also looked for a location to do their experiments. That location required steady winds, relatively flat terrain, and no trees or other structures to get in the way. Based on US Weather Bureau reports and other sources, they settled on Kill Devil Hills close to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The ground was fine sand (for soft landings), there were some reasonable dunes for takeoffs, and the Atlantic coast location offered good winds. 15 This section is based on a variety of sources but primarily Marvin McFarland’s The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright (New York: McGraw Hill, 1953). 16 McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright, 7. Orville Wright, Diagram of Wright brothers’ 1899 kite (1920 or before) Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 65 1900 In the early part of 1900, Wilbur began an exchange of letters with Chanute who provided valu- able information. The Wrights travelled to Kitty Hawk in September 1900 with Wilbur arriving three weeks before Orville. Wilbur’s first task was to build the glider with the materials they had shipped ahead. When Orville arrived, they started their testing program and continued to the end of October when they returned home. Most of this period was devoted to flying the glider as a kite but, towards the end of October, Wilbur managed a manned flight of about 200 feet. Importantly, over these manned test flights, Wilbur judged that he had reasonably good control of the glider using a forward elevator surface for pitch control and wing-warping for roll. Once back in Dayton, Wilbur began another exchange of letters with Chanute. 1901 The brothers arrived at Kitty Hawk on July 11, 1901, for their experiments with a new glider, this one larger with about 300 square feet of wing surface. Based on the estimates of Lilienthal, they reckoned this would be more than enough for them to glide. They made about 120 manned flights, one as long as 400 feet. But, overall, they were disappointed with the performance of their new design for a couple of reasons. For one, the actual lift they got from the new design (1 in 12 camber on the wings) was much less that what Lilienthal’s tables suggested. For another, they found that wing-warping did not produce the relatively smooth turn they expected. The glider would start to turn, but then the nose would start drifting away from the direction of turn. Today, we know this as the problem of adverse yaw. On the whole, the brothers judged it to be a disappointing flying season with some discussion about whether to continue. They left Kitty Hawk for Dayton on August 20 demoralized. By the time October rolled around, the two had re-energized and decided to have a closer look at the design of their wings. To do so, they built a wind tunnel and looked at 200 wing designs before narrowing to 48 designs for closer examination. Wind tunnels were in general use, but had not yet been used to study wing design. The brothers were trying to determine the effects of various wing design parameters on lift and drag performance. The description of these experiments in McFarland is the better part of 100 pages and is a rich source of early data on wing design. Orville wrote this: During the following three or four months after October 1901 we made thousands of measurements of the lift, and the ratio of the lift to drift [drag] with these two instruments. We measured the lift of square planes and rectangular planes of different aspect ratios, in order to determine the effect of the aspect ratio on the lifting qualities of the plane. We also made measurements of a number of similarly curved surfaces having different cambers to determine the effect of camber on the lift and also on the drift.17 17 Orville Wright, How We Invented the Airplane (New York: Dover, 1953), 18. 66 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement The discovery of the aspect ratio (AR) and its effects on lift and drag were important. The AR of a wing is the ratio of the span of the wings squared to the area of the wings. For a rectangular wing, this formula simplifies to the span of the wings (tip to tip) divided by their width. The basic experimental finding was that higher ARs gave much better lift/drag char- acteristics. The AR ratio for the 1901 glider was a little over 3. The brothers felt that if they went to a wing design with an AR of 6 or 7, the glider would have sufficient lift for flight. 1902 The Wrights arrived at Kitty Hawk on August 28 and over the next two weeks assembled their new design. They had settled on a wing with a span of 32 ft and a width of 5 ft (for an AR of 32/5 = 6.4) and this certainly solved their lift problem. What remained was the adverse yaw problem. Let’s have a closer look at the 1902 glider. It’s shown at the bottom of this page with Wilbur at the controls. It was a bi-wing design with both wing surfaces having a cambered airfoil. The pilot also had a control to “warp” the wings in order to roll. The small horizontal surface just in front of Wilbur’s face served for elevator control. The vertical rudder in the rear was fixed. It could not move. The brothers had included it because they thought it would lead to more stable flight. In fact, they had tried the rudder in a number of positions as Orville suggested in a letter to his sister Katherine: We tried it with the tail in front, behind, and every other way. When we got through, Will was so mixed up he couldn’t even theorize. It has been with considerable effort that I have succeeded in keeping him in the flying business at all.18 18 McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright, 38. Everett Collection Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 67 But regardless of where they put the tail, they were still having problems. They were able to manage roll and pitch but could not yet control yaw. That is, when the nose drifted left or right, they had no way to bring the glider back to the original heading. What’s more, when they warped the wings to go into a banked turn, sometimes the glider would exhibit adverse yaw. On the night of October 3, 1902, Orville could not sleep, so he got up and began to go through the problem again in his mind. What he came to was that they needed to be able to move the rudder. The next morning, he suggested his solution to Wilbur expecting an argu- ment. Surprisingly Wilbur thought about it briefly and then agreed. Let’s consider how this solves the problem of adverse yaw on a banked turn. With the rudder now able to move, the brothers were able to get the nose to go left and right indepen- dent of any other movement of the flight controls. In other words, they now had yaw control. When they wanted to do a banked turn to the right, say, they not only applied the wing warp- ing but also moved the rudder to the right and, once they got used to the sensitivity of the combined controls, they were able to execute smooth banked turns. The movement of the rudder stopped the adverse yaw. Yaw and adverse yaw were the last pieces of the puzzle of flight control. They could now control flight in all three dimensions. It was now time to add power which they planned to do for the next flying season in 1903. Most historians mark December 17, 1903, as the historic day, the day of man’s first powered flight. But some go back to Orville’s October 3, 1902, rudder insight as the key date. Over the 1902 flying season, they made about 750 glides with the longest at just over 600 feet. They left Kitty on October 28 pleased with their progress. They had now cracked the code of flying in three dimensions and from there it was a matter of adding power and refining the design. They were all set to make history the following flying season. The Point The story of the Wright Brothers and flight is an example of serious ideation. The brothers were able to figure out the principles of flight that stand to this day. My point is not so much their amazing ingenuity and imagination but rather the role of exographics, experiment, and measurement in support of their imaginations. The Wrights could not have done their work without exographics and measurement. 3.5 A Reinterpretation of Bruegel’s “Temperance” The engraving on the next page is Temperance (1560) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder 1525–1569 CE). In his book, The Measure of Reality, Alfred Crosby offers this engraving as a “peephole 68 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement through which we may see samples if not all of a society’s bromides, then of what it is think- ing about with freshest intensity, and even of how it is thinking.”19 He goes on to suggest this question: In the mid-ninth century A. D. Ibn Khurradadhbeh described Western Europe as a course of “eunuchs, slave girls and boys, brocade, beaver skins, glue, sables, and swords,” and not much more. A century later another Muslim geographer, the great Masudi, wrote that Europeans were dull in mind and heavy in speech, and the “farther they are to the north the more stupid, gross, and brutish they are.” ... Six centuries later the Franks were at least equal to, and even ahead of, the Muslims and everyone else in the world in certain kinds of mathematics and mechanical innovation. They were in the first stage of developing science- cum-technology that would be the glory of their civilization and the edged weapon of their imperialistic expansion. How, between the ninth and the sixteenth centuries, had these bumpkins managed all that?20 Crosby argues that the answer is measurement and that it clearly shows up in Bruegel’s engraving. But I have a different take. Let’s have a closer look. 19 Alfred Crosby, The Measure of Reality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 5. 20 Crosby, The Measure of Reality, 3–4.

On the left, through the opening in the curtain, you can see the Prompter and he looks to be following the play’s script (an exographic) in order to be able to advise actors when they forget their lines or movements.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Temperance (Temperantia) from The Virtues (ca. 1559–1560). 70 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement Below the choir, we see commercial activity: This would appear to be the operation of a money-changer. At the time the engraving was done, cities and towns typically issued their own coins (paper money had yet to be invented). Certainly, Bruegel’s Antwerp of the 16th century was an international city with a brisk trade. When travelling merchants visited, they would normally meet with a money-changer to exchange their tender for the town’s so they could do business with local merchants. It was not unusual for a travelling merchant to keep a book of account with the money-changer and these transactions would have to be recorded. Perhaps those are discarded receipts (exographics) on the ground? To the right, we see the money-changer working at his table, checking his journal (an exographic) and counting out coins (these coins are a store of value and also exograms21). Perhaps the person to the left is making a receipt (an exographic): he is clearly writing with a pen in his right hand and an inkwell in his left. In behind, a man is making what looks to be counting symbols (exographics) on a bellows. Finally, to the far left, there is an artist with his back to the viewer. Could this be Bruegel drawing himself into the piece? Maybe. All in, there is lots of exographic activity in this scene. 21 My focus has been on exographics in their role to support ideation. But as Merlin Donald has pointed out, they’ve been used for other cognitive purposes. See his paper “The Exographic Revolution: Neuropsychological Sequelae,” in The Cognitive Life of Things: Recasting the Boundaries of the Mind, eds. Lambros Malafouris and Colin Renfrew (Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge, 2010).

Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 71 Let’s now move sideways to the scene on the lower right: This appears to be some sort of reading class. The master, seated on the far right is going over the ABCs with a student. All other figures are reading. For some reason the master does not look very happy. Could the spatula in his left hand and the branch under his belt be devices of discipline about to be used? Regardless, there is lots of exographic activity here. Now let’s move to the scene immediately above: Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Temperance (Temperantia) from The Virtues (ca. 1559–1560). Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Temperance (Temperantia) from The Virtues (ca. 1559–1560). 72 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement These figures appear to be clergy in lively debate. The Protestant Reformation had been underway for forty years so there was lots to talk about. Judging by his clothes, the person with hands extended might be a rabbi. There is a lectern on the right with what appears to be a large volume, possibly a Bible and perhaps a Gutenberg Bible.22 There is also a similar- looking book on the ground leaning against the lectern. So, in this scene, there is not much measurement but lots of dialectic and some exographics. The final scene is the top right corner: There is lots of measurement going on here. First, there is the astronomer standing on the globe looking to the moon and using what appears to be a compass. Then there is the cartog- rapher making a measurement on the globe. To the right of the cartographer, there is a man looking up the line of a stick with a wheel attached to the end of the stick. This is likely an alidade, a device for making measurements along a line of sight to an object. Immediately below is a man using a square, something you can’t quite see in this picture but you can in the complete picture. There are three men close to the column. Two are on it. The one at the top is using a plumb-bob. The one sitting about midway up the column is using a compass. And the one at the bottom looks as though he is recording the measurements (exographics) taken by the other two. Finally, on the far right, there are instruments of war: two cannons, a soldier with a rifle, and an archer with a cross-bow. In the 16th century, war was a national sport in Europe. Bruegel had to include some reference to it if the scene was to be representative. 22 This engraving was done in 1559 a full century after the first run of the Gutenberg printing press produced the so-called Gutenberg Bible. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Temperance (Temperantia) from The Virtues (ca. 1559–1560). Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 73 To sum up, I have already observed that, without a number system and exographics, there can be no measurement. Hence, as I see it, this engraving suggests that exographics are play- ing an important role. Yes, measurement is important, but it’s not the complete story.23 3.6 Summary Later, I’ll document how writing came about in a number of other areas besides Mesopotamia. It generally starts with the briefest of notations, usually recording economic transactions. Hence measurement and the initiation of exographics tend to go hand in hand. From this humble beginning in Mesopotamia, measurement is now endemic in our techno-literate cultures. We measure everything.

For example, if a child is shown that one group has 3 marbles and another has 4 marbles, a teacher might then ask how many marbles there are altogether.

In his 2001 visit to the Oksapmin, Saxe noticed the word “fu” being used in a different way. When used with a particular body part, its new meaning was to double the value of that body part. After making sure that he had interpreted the meaning correctly, Saxe realized that arithmetic had finally arrived and so he began to document its use. Here is an example Saxe documents of a shopkeeper doing some arithmetic using the body-counting system. The problem is to subtract 7 from 16. To do this, the shopkeeper begins by pointing to his left ear which is the body-part associated with 16. He then breaks 16 into two parts. He first points to his right shoulder indicating 10. Then, he points to his left wrist indicating 6.","content_length":872,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"So now he has two numbers marked, 10 on his right side, and 6 on his left side.

One gets transferred to the left forearm, another to the left elbow, and another to his left bicep. This makes a total of 9 (the original 6 on the left side and then the 3 numbers transferred) which he claims is the answer to his problem. Most of us would consider this to be a trivial problem. We can all do the calculation 16 − 7 = 9 easily. But the shopkeeper has internalized arithmetic and numbers in a different way.

We are not who we are by grand design but by a process of local incremental improvement. More importantly for my argument, the Oksapmin had to get their number system into their visual field and they did so with their body-counting system. Effectively the body-counting system is the three- dimensional equivalent to our two-dimensional exographics system of number representation and manipulation.

With Uruk at its peak, the Sumerians mass produced textiles and pottery and traded with other Mesopotamian settlements for what they needed. What is clear is that Uruk was able to generate a considerable economic surplus largely from the fields and trade. This, in turn, allowed them to undertake massive public projects like the many large temples in the Eannu district.

The Principles of Fixed-Wing Powered Flight To fly, two problems need to be solved. First you have to get the machine into the air, and, once it’s in the air, you have to be able to control its movement.","content_length":987,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"Let’s first look at the problem of getting into the air. The Airbus A380 is presently the largest passenger aircraft in the world. It can accommodate up to 850 passengers and its takeoff weight is approximatly 575,000 kgs. It’s hard to believe that this behemoth can get off the ground. How is it done? If an aircraft is to fly, the four forces acting on it have to be in balance. One force is gravity which points down and acts to keep the aircraft on the ground. Basically, it’s the weight of the aircraft. Another is the force of the air on the aircraft as it moves through the air. This force is called drag and it points in the direction opposite the aircraft’s direction of flight. You can think of drag as the oncoming “wall” of air that opposes the aircraft’s movement forward.","content_length":785,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"To overcome these two forces, there are two additional forces, thrust and lift. In the case of the A380, the jet engines provide thrust which causes the aircraft to move forward. What gets it into the air is lift, a force that is generated by the combination of thrust and the shape of the aircraft’s wings. I’ll illustrate with a couple of simple experiments. Imagine you’re in a speeding car. You put your hand out the window with palm flat to the horizontal with fingers together and pointing in the direction of movement. The force acting on your hand 62 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement is minimal. Now imagine bending your hand at the wrist so your fingers move up slightly, perhaps a couple of inches, revealing your palm to the oncoming wind. This wind exerts a lift force on the underside of your hand; you can feel it because your hand wants to move further up. Keep in mind what is going on here.","content_length":912,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"It’s the thrust which causes the aircraft to go through the air creating the wind and therefore the force. Now imagine that, from the horizontal position, you move your fingers down. As you move them down, you feel the force of the oncoming wind on back of your hand and, as a result, your hand wants to move further down. From this, we see that if a moving aircraft’s wings are inclined slightly up so that the oncoming air hits the underside of the wing surface, then a lift force will be generated. But that’s not the complete story of lift. Cut a rectangular strip of paper a couple inches wide and about a foot long. Hold the short side against your lower lip so that the long side sags down. Now blow air across the top of the surface of the paper. This causes the paper to lift into the air and, if you blow hard enough, it gets to a horizontal position.","content_length":861,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"When you eventually stop blowing, the paper sags downward again. What is happening? Effectively you are blowing air away from the top surface of the paper. This causes air from below to want to fill that space and in the process an upward force—lift—is put on the paper. In aerodynamic terms, the blown air creates low-pressure air above the paper and the higher-pressure air from below then pushes up to try and fill the low-pressure space. So how do we get the air to move more quickly over the top of the wing of an aircraft cre- ating the dichotomy of pressures necessary for lift?

Now to control. The first concept to understand is the aircraft’s center of gravity. This is a point approximately halfway down the fuselage where the aircraft would exactly balance if you were to support it underneath only at this point. To see how the aircraft can change direction, I’ll begin by defining three axes and then the movement of the aircraft about those axes. Once I do that, I’ll describe what control sur- faces are employed to affect each movement. We could think of a lateral axis running parallel to the wings (perpendicular to the fuselage) and going through the center of gravity.","content_length":819,"content_tokens":178,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"If the aircraft changes its pitch, the nose will go up or down depending on what the pilot wants to do.

If the pilot affects a movement where the nose of the aircraft goes left, then the back of the aircraft will go right to affect the rotation around the vertical axis. This movement of the aircraft around the verti- cal axis is called yaw. Finally, imagine an axis running the length of the fuselage and through the center of gravity. Rotation of the fuselage around this axis is called roll.

They can either be turned up or down and when one is turned up, the other must be turned down. The ailerons always move in the opposite direc- tion. Their purpose is to cause the aircraft to roll (rotate around its longitudinal axis) When a pilot wishes to roll to the left (i. e., the left wing is down and the right wing is up), the aileron on the left wing is turned up and the one on the right wing is turned down. Aircraft have short horizontal fins attached at the rear of the fuselage.","content_length":845,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"They look like stubby wings. These are called horizontal stabilizers and the elevators are the flaps attached to the trailing edge of these stabilizers. Like the ailerons, they conform to the shape of the stabilizers when not engaged. But when engaged, they move either up or down together. If they are turned up, the nose of the plane turns up. Similarly, if they are turned down, the nose of the plane turns down. The final control surface is the rudder. All aircraft have a vertical fin, the vertical stabi- lizer, coming out of the rear of the fuselage. The rudder is the flap attached to the rear end of the vertical stabilizer and it either turns left or right.

Let’s now go back to the work the Wrights did to discover these primary controls. The Wrights and Their Experimentation When the Wrights began their work on flight in 1899, they could only work at it part-time as they had a successful bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Basically, the late spring and summer were reserved for the bicycle shop and the rest of the year for their experiments and study of flight. Neither brother married so, without family obligations, they had time to pursue their inquiry. They were aware of Edison’s and Alexander Graham Bell’s inventions as well as the AC Drone 64 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement technological upheaval of the Industrial Revolution.","content_length":924,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"It was certainly an age of technological discovery and they resolved to be a part of it. Both were young (in 1900, Wilbur was 33 and Orville, 29) and brought considerable energy to their endeavours. Both inherited a significant mechanical ability from their mother who did most of the upkeep around the family home. Their father was a clergyman, and by all accounts, had difficulty pounding a nail. Let’s now look at some of the details of their work over the critical period from 1899 to 1902.15 1899 Their first decision was to study gliding. They adopted the bi-wing design of Octave Chanute’s primarily because the box-like structure of the wings offered overall strength.","content_length":676,"content_tokens":145,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"Furthermore, they had decided that trying to control the flight of a glider by just “the shifting of the weight of their bodies” (as Lilienthal had done) was a mistake.16 Based on a close observation of birds, Wilbur thought that a gliding bird appeared to “warp” its wings (one wing tip would go up and the other down) in order to change direction. The brothers decided to try the same principle. Orville’s picture of such a warping is shown in below. Note that the warping was hand controlled from the ground. This warping was tested in July and it worked well. It had the same effect as modern ailerons causing the kite to roll and change direction. Towards the end of November, the brothers decided to build a bigger glider to test in 1900 and they also looked for a location to do their experiments.","content_length":804,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"That location required steady winds, relatively flat terrain, and no trees or other structures to get in the way. Based on US Weather Bureau reports and other sources, they settled on Kill Devil Hills close to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The ground was fine sand (for soft landings), there were some reasonable dunes for takeoffs, and the Atlantic coast location offered good winds. 15 This section is based on a variety of sources but primarily Marvin McFarland’s The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright (New York: McGraw Hill, 1953) 16 McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright, 7.

Wilbur’s first task was to build the glider with the materials they had shipped ahead. When Orville arrived, they started their testing program and continued to the end of October when they returned home. Most of this period was devoted to flying the glider as a kite but, towards the end of October, Wilbur managed a manned flight of about 200 feet. Importantly, over these manned test flights, Wilbur judged that he had reasonably good control of the glider using a forward elevator surface for pitch control and wing-warping for roll. Once back in Dayton, Wilbur began another exchange of letters with Chanute. 1901 The brothers arrived at Kitty Hawk on July 11, 1901, for their experiments with a new glider, this one larger with about 300 square feet of wing surface.","content_length":875,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"Based on the estimates of Lilienthal, they reckoned this would be more than enough for them to glide. They made about 120 manned flights, one as long as 400 feet. But, overall, they were disappointed with the performance of their new design for a couple of reasons. For one, the actual lift they got from the new design (1 in 12 camber on the wings) was much less that what Lilienthal’s tables suggested. For another, they found that wing-warping did not produce the relatively smooth turn they expected. The glider would start to turn, but then the nose would start drifting away from the direction of turn. Today, we know this as the problem of adverse yaw. On the whole, the brothers judged it to be a disappointing flying season with some discussion about whether to continue. They left Kitty Hawk for Dayton on August 20 demoralized.","content_length":838,"content_tokens":182,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"By the time October rolled around, the two had re-energized and decided to have a closer look at the design of their wings. To do so, they built a wind tunnel and looked at 200 wing designs before narrowing to 48 designs for closer examination. Wind tunnels were in general use, but had not yet been used to study wing design. The brothers were trying to determine the effects of various wing design parameters on lift and drag performance. The description of these experiments in McFarland is the better part of 100 pages and is a rich source of early data on wing design. Orville wrote this: During the following three or four months after October 1901 we made thousands of measurements of the lift, and the ratio of the lift to drift [drag] with these two instruments. We measured the lift of square planes and rectangular planes of different aspect ratios, in order to determine the effect of the aspect ratio on the lifting qualities of the plane.","content_length":952,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"We also made measurements of a number of similarly curved surfaces having different cambers to determine the effect of camber on the lift and also on the drift.17 17 Orville Wright, How We Invented the Airplane (New York: Dover, 1953), 18. 66 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement The discovery of the aspect ratio (AR) and its effects on lift and drag were important. The AR of a wing is the ratio of the span of the wings squared to the area of the wings. For a rectangular wing, this formula simplifies to the span of the wings (tip to tip) divided by their width. The basic experimental finding was that higher ARs gave much better lift/drag char- acteristics. The AR ratio for the 1901 glider was a little over 3.

Let’s have a closer look at the 1902 glider. It’s shown at the bottom of this page with Wilbur at the controls. It was a bi-wing design with both wing surfaces having a cambered airfoil. The pilot also had a control to “warp” the wings in order to roll. The small horizontal surface just in front of Wilbur’s face served for elevator control. The vertical rudder in the rear was fixed.

Everett Collection Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement 67 But regardless of where they put the tail, they were still having problems. They were able to manage roll and pitch but could not yet control yaw. That is, when the nose drifted left or right, they had no way to bring the glider back to the original heading.

Surprisingly Wilbur thought about it briefly and then agreed. Let’s consider how this solves the problem of adverse yaw on a banked turn. With the rudder now able to move, the brothers were able to get the nose to go left and right indepen- dent of any other movement of the flight controls.

It was now time to add power which they planned to do for the next flying season in 1903. Most historians mark December 17, 1903, as the historic day, the day of man’s first powered flight. But some go back to Orville’s October 3, 1902, rudder insight as the key date. Over the 1902 flying season, they made about 750 glides with the longest at just over 600 feet.

The brothers were able to figure out the principles of flight that stand to this day. My point is not so much their amazing ingenuity and imagination but rather the role of exographics, experiment, and measurement in support of their imaginations. The Wrights could not have done their work without exographics and measurement. 3.5 A Reinterpretation of Bruegel’s “Temperance” The engraving on the next page is Temperance (1560) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder 1525–1569 CE)","content_length":754,"content_tokens":169,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and Measurement","content":"In his book, The Measure of Reality, Alfred Crosby offers this engraving as a “peephole 68 Chapter 3 Exographics and Measurement through which we may see samples if not all of a society’s bromides, then of what it is think- ing about with freshest intensity, and even of how it is thinking.”19 He goes on to suggest this question: In the mid-ninth century A.

It generally starts with the briefest of notations, usually recording economic transactions. Hence measurement and the initiation of exographics tend to go hand in hand.

In this chapter, I first describe the structure of the A Class. Then I’ll assess how it has grown over time. 4.1 Defining the A Class Recall that the Ideasphere is the set of all of the ideas we’ve had over our cultural his- tory. The “we” here is all human cultures. Even though the Ideasphere is a set of ideas, it’s equivalently a collection of cultural objects, including beliefs, concepts, material artifacts, activities, behaviours, etc. I defined the A Class to be all those ideas which required exographics, either directly or indirectly, to discover. As I have argued, exographics allows us to bring abstract concepts into our visual fields where we can manipulate them and mould them into an idea. For example, suppose we need to find 4 consecutive even integers whose sum is 484. We can use exographics as follows. Let x be the lowest integer. Then the next three even integers are x + 2, x + 4, and x + 6. If we add these four integers, we get x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) = 4x + 12 and solving 4x + 12 = 484 we get x = 118 and the integers are 118, 120, 122, and 124. That is a difficult problem to do in your head, although you could do some intelligent experimenting. For example, the average of the four numbers has to be pretty close to 484/4 = 121. Furthermore, because the integers are not the same, you know that the lowest one must be below 121, say 120, or 118, or 116. Then for each of these, you could sum up the four consecutive even numbers beginning with 75 Einstein 76 Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class that number. The point of this example is that exographics gives us a way of bringing the abstract concepts—in this case, algebra and equations—to our visual field where we can manipulate them as we did above. For my purposes, there is no need to enumerate all of the ideas in the A Class. We simply have to know how the A Class is defined and how to determine whether a particular idea is a member of the A Class. For example, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus could not have been discovered or proved without access to exographics. Consequently, it’s in the A Class. The James Webb Space Telescope is a complex amalgam of technologies that took two decades and $10 billion to construct. Even though it’s a concrete object, it’s in the A Class by virtue of the large number of components whose science and engineering would have been impossible without exographics. As shown in the last chapter, another way to show that an idea is in the A Class is to assess whether measurement is involved in discovering the idea. If it is, then the idea is in the A Class. On this basis, the James Webb Space Telescope is in the A Class. A lot of work has been done by primatologists trying to understand the essential differ- ence in chimpanzee and human intelligence. In this regard, Claudio Tennie, Josep Call, and Michael Tomasello have argued: Regardless of whether chimpanzee and human culture share some common mechanisms, which they almost certainly do, what is undeniable, we would claim, is that human culture is an evolutionarily unique phenomenon. Prima facie evidence of this uniqueness is the kind of products human cultures produce: material and symbolic artefacts from industrialized technologies to language, to money and to symbolic mathematics. These cultural products suggest the possibility of some unique types of cultural transmission processes in humans. Also important in a full assessment of human culture are humans’ many unique forms of cooperative social practices and institutions from marriage to religions to governments.1 What they are suggesting is that our ability to ideate is what separates us. However, there are many examples of culture generation by other species, and particularly by chimpanzees. But, for sure, there is no other species that does A Class ideation. Yes, other species do C class ideation, but none of these do A Class ideation. 4.2 The Structure of the A Class We are adding to the Ideasphere and A Class daily. Hence there is a distinct time element to the structure of the A Class. There is also an interrelatedness of the ideas themselves. For example, we couldn’t invent the integrated circuit without a fundamental understanding of electricity and circuits. Newton 1 Claudio Tennie, Josep Call, and Michael Tomasello, “Ratcheting Up the Ratchet: On the Evolution of Cumulative Culture,” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 364, no. 1528 (2009): 2405. Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class 77 could not have ideated the calculus without the preceding development of algebra. Another good example is the smart phone. It’s a collection of antecedent technologies including: a high- quality digital camera, a GPS system, a high-speed data modem to connect to the Internet, a touchscreen interface, SIM cards that give each phone a unique identity, and a host of other technologies including just about a limitless supply of apps. In turn, these technologies all depend on their own antecedent technologies. For example, the digital camera capability has a relatively long history dating back to the 1950s when engineers started to think about recording pictures digitally with a large array of semiconductor sensors. Since then, there have been many technological breakthroughs including algorithms for compressing picture data for storage and transfer. All of these technologies have enabled the smart phone cameras of today, cameras that drive the picture and video content of social media. If we look at the history of every bit of tech- nology in the smart phone, a lot of it could be traced to early abstract ideas in science, engineer- ing, and mathematics. Take for example, the smart phone GPS system. The mathematics and physics are straightforward, but someone had to sit down and work through these fundamental calculations, calculations that require exographics. If we were to combine these dimensions of time and relatedness, we could think of the A Class as a collection of veins, where a vein is a set of related ideas over time. An example is mathematics. The first significant number systems were developed by the Sumerians about five millennia ago to deal with practical problems in geometry and astronomy. The etymology of “geometry” goes back to the ancient Greek with “geo” for earth, and “metria” for measurement. To deal with these “land measurement” problems, the Sumerians devel- oped a positional number system that included fractions, certainly a stunning achievement. Since that time, the vein of mathematics has grown considerably. The Mathematics Subject Classification now has 60-plus areas and a student wishing to do an advanced degree in mathematics would specialize in one of these. Furthermore, if you look at a mathematics professor’s personal library, it would no doubt include shelves of books in his or her area and, in addition, he or she would have instant access to the latest research via papers pub- lished on the Internet. The vein of mathematics has come a long way and, now, comprises many sub-veins. 4.3 The Ratchet Effect, Revolutionary Ideas, and Swarm The Light Bulb Thomas Edison is often given credit for inventing the electric light bulb. But he was not the first to think about the concept. The impetus for its invention goes back to the turn of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, a change powered largely by coal. Coal mines were very dangerous places to work. At that time, candles were used for light- ing and sometimes these caused “firedamp” (a mixture of methane and air found largely in coal mines) to explode. Ninety-two men and boys died in the explosion at Felling colliery on 78 Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class May 25, 1812, and there were numerous other accidents. About this time a number of scien- tists—William Clanny, Humphry Davy, and George Stephenson—began to work indepen- dently on the problem of lighting in mines in order to reduce the risk of explosion. There is some debate about who produced the first safety lamp. Clanny produced his in 1815 shortly after the Felling disaster. In a Royal Society paper, the device was described this way: For the purpose of preventing such accidents, Dr. Clanny has contrived to insulate a candle, by water placed both above and below the lantern in which it is contained. The air, which is intended to support the flame, is supplied by means of a pair of common bellows, by which it is forced through the water beneath the flame; and it is again emitted, after having supported the combustion, by a bent tube that passes into water from the top of the lantern. In consequence of this arrangement, if the air of the mine becomes liable to inflame, the explosion will be confined to the mere content of the lantern, of which only a small part will be consumed, unless the quantity of inflammable gas be very suddenly increased.2 The idea is to light a flame in a space surrounded by glass to limit the risk of an explosion. About this same time, Humphry Davy was running current through narrow carbon fibers to produce light. Eventually he also produced an enclosed lamp, the Davy Lamp, that also limited the risk of explosion in mines. The point of this history is that Edison had some broad shoulders to stand on when he started work on the electric light bulb. Since the time of Edison, we’ve improved his incandescent light bulb and more recently we’ve gone to LED lightbulbs, which have a life 25 times longer than the best incandescent bulb. Good ideas draw attention. The Ratchet Effect Of some importance is our ability to notice new ideas and then not forget them. Michael Tomasello has labelled this ability the ratchet effect for good reason. In an engineering con- text, a ratchet is “a mechanical device that allows continuous linear or rotary motion in only one direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction.”3 Of course, this is exactly what happens within the Ideasphere: once we notice a good idea, we don’t lose track of it. This ability gives rise to cumulative culture. There have been rare occurrences of loss in the A Class. Lucio Russo documents that much of Hellenistic science and mathematics (circa 300 BCE) was lost in its transmission through Rome to the Dark Ages and Medieval Europe.4 But this doesn’t happen very often. Based on my reading of intellectual history, I think Thomas Kuhn’s ideas about how sci- ence progresses also apply to much of A Class ideation.5 There are periods of normal ideation 2 William Clanny, “On the Means of procuring a steady Light in Coal Mines without the danger of Explosion,” Philosophi- cal Transactions of the Royal Society (London: Royal Society, 1813), 200. 3 Taken from the Wikipedia entry for “Ratchet (device)”. 4 Lucio Russo, The Forgotten Revolution (Springer Verlag: Berlin, 2004). 5 Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962). 0.0000450% 0.0000400% 0.0000350% 0.0000300% 0.0000250% 0.0000200% 0.0000150% 0.0000100% 0.0000050% 0.0000000% google Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class 79 and then periods of revolutionary change where a new idea directs ideation into a new vein or sub-vein. Kuhn’s example of the Copernican Revolution is a good one. The orthodoxy was inter- rupted by Copernicus’s idea that the Sun, and not the Earth, was the center of universe. Another example is the invention of the integrated circuit. This single invention led to major advances in technology not the least of which is the great advance in the power of modern computers. Related to Kuhn’s theory, one of the characteristics of A Class ideas is that good ones draw the attention of other minds. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection has drawn the attention of biologists, geneticists, and other scientists for the last 160 years. It was a clever idea that has informed a lot of interdisciplinary research. I will refer to novel ideas that draw significant attention from other minds as root ideas and the attention itself as cognitive swarm or just swarm. Swarm is a characteristic of our inquisitive natures and is part of the explanation of our knack for cumulative culture. Good ideas draw swarm. Here is a more modern example of swarm. Sergey Brin and Larry Page, two graduate students in the Computer Science Department at Stanford had an idea for a search engine for the Internet. They began working on it in their dormitory rooms and soon came up with a pro- totype code they called Backrub. Backrub was eventually renamed Google and was released in August 1996. One way to assess the attention an idea gets is to do an Ngram Viewer search of it. This search looks at all books in English over a specific period of time and calculates the frequency of the word’s use. The Ngram Viewer search of “Google” produces the graph below: 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 The Ngram Reviewer Results for a Search Using the Search Word “google.” As you can see, the curve begins to increase about 1996. Google attracted a lot of attention both from users and those intent on producing search engines. According to Search Engine Journal, there are now at least 17 other Internet search engines including Bing (the Microsoft entry released in 2009), Yandex, and DuckDuckGo.6 6 See https://www. searchenginejournal. com/alternative-search-engines/271409/. © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company 80 Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class Quantum computing has also captured considerable attention. The idea is attributed to physicist Paul Benioff in the early 1980s. The Ngram Viewer output for a “quantum comput- ing” search shows the same pattern as Google’s. It began to rise about 1990 and has continued its upward ascent. According to the Wikipedia, there are now 55 firms involved in various aspects of the development of quantum computing for communications.7 Like Google and other search engines, quantum computing has attracted a lot of attention. 4.4 The Growth in Selected Veins of the A Class Harvey Leyman did some remarkable work to document the growth of the A Class over long periods of time.8 The following table sets out a selection of the veins and time periods he looked at: Subject Philosophy Geology Genetics Pathology Education Mathematics 1 Mathematics 2 Chemistry Medicine and Hygiene Economy and Political Science “Best Books” Time Period 1275–1875 CE 1500–1900 CE 1675–1900 CE 1225–1875 CE 1350–1850 CE 1450–1900 CE 1450–1900 CE 1550–1900 CE 1275–1875 CE 1525–1875 CE 1525–1875 CE For each of these time periods and subjects, Leyman consulted a variety of sources includ- ing chronologies and encyclopaedias and, in each year, counted the number of inventions and discoveries. For example, he consulted 50 histories of philosophy. Mathematics 1 and 2 are each based on a particular history of mathematics and “Best Books” is based on some significant data work by Asa Dickinson.9 7 See https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/List_of_companies_involved_in_quantum_computing_or_communication. 8 Harvey Leyman, “The Exponential Increase of Man’s Cultural Output,” Social Forces 25, no. 3 (1947). 9 Asa Dickinson, One Thousand Best Books (Garden City: Page & Co, 1925) Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class 81 The graphs of “Number of Contributions” versus “Time” for five of these subjects is shown below:10 1500 1000 500 0 1200 1300 Medicine & Hygiene Chemistry Mathematics 1 Mathematics 2 Education 1400 1500 1600 1700 Year 1800 1900 All of these plots are consistent with an exponential increase in the number of contributions. The plots of the other subjects not shown on this graph also show the same exponential increase, albeit with different exponential parameter estimates. Leyman’s work suggests the content of the veins in the A Class are increasing at an exponential rate. Another way to assess the expansion of the A Class is to look at the way university fields of study have changed. If you go back to the formation of universities in medieval Europe, a very simple curriculum was taught. It consisted of the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) followed by the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). Some professional arts were taught, subjects like medicine and architecture, but the primary programs were the preparatory work of the Trivium followed by the Quadrivium. Contrast that with the disciplines of study in a modern university. Figure 4.3 below is representative.11 As you can see, there are many more fields and these reflect the exponential expansion of the A Class. As for depth in any particular discipline, we’ve mentioned the number of fields in math- ematics. Let’s now look at these in more detail. Mathematics is usually divided into pure mathematics and applied mathematics. Fields in pure mathematics would include: algebra, 10 This diagram is from Magnus Enquist, Stefano Ghirlander, Arne Jarrick, and Carl-Adam Wachtmeister, “Why Does Human Culture Increase Exponentially?” Theoretical Population Biology 74, no. 1, (2008): 47. 11 See https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/List_of_academic_fields#/media/File:Disciplines_mind_map. jpg © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company No. of contributions 82 Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company Professions Public-policy Physical-performance-Recreation Environmental-studies-Forestry Family-Consumer-science Public-administration Social-work Agriculture Medicine Engineering-Technology Architecture-Design Transportation Business Humanities Journalism-Media-Communication Library-Museum-studies Military-sciences Human-history Intelligence Philosophy Linguistics Religion Literature DISCIPLINES Education Mathematics Statistics Systems-science Archaeology Area-studies Geography Anthropology Cultural-Ethnic-studies Gender-Sexuality-studies Psychology Sociology Economics Political-science Physics Chemistry Biology Earth-sciences Space-sciences Computer-sciences Natural-sciences Applied-mathematics Pure-mathematics Social-sciences Formal-sciences The Structure of Disciplines in a Modern University Logic Divinity Law Arts 450,000 400,000 350,000 300,000 250,000 200,000 150,000 100,000 50,000 0 1960 1970 Yearly Patent Grants/US Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class 83 analysis, probability theory, geometry and topology, number theory, and logic and foun- dations. Applied mathematics includes: approximation theory, computational mathematics, numerical analysis, operational research, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, infor- mation theory, cryptography, steganography, combinatorics, graph theory, and game theory. Each of these fields includes a number of subject areas. For instance, algebra includes group theory, ring theory, commutative algebra, field theory, linear algebra, universal algebra, homological algebra, differential algebra, lattice theory, representation theory, K-theory, and category theory. For each of these subject areas, introductory and advanced textbooks have been written. Plus, there is ongoing research in each of these areas published in specialized journals. There is some significant depth to modern mathematics. There is also significant ideation in the private sector. The top 10 technology firms in the United States are: Microsoft (software), Apple (computer hardware and peripherals), Amazon (Internet retailer), Alphabet (Google, search engine, other), Facebook (social media), Visa (data processing and outsources services), Mastercard (data processing and outsourced services), Intel (semiconductors), AT&T (integrated telecommunications), and Verizon (inte- grated telecommunications). As a group, these ten firms have moved us much closer to McLu- han’s global village. They provide us an amazing communication and thinking scaffolding that we will continue to learn how to use. What’s more, if the past has taught us anything, it’s that this technological growth will continue. A Class ideation begets more A Class ideation. Another way to show the increase in A Class is with patent data. The following chart shows the number of patents granted each year in the US over the period 1963–2019: 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 The patents granted have gone from less than 50,000 in 1963 to almost 400,000 in 2019. Now admittedly some of these patents would properly be placed in the C Class, but the vast majority are in the A Class. © U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. Redrawn by Kendall Hunt Publishing.

Once again, none of this is possible without exographics. 4.5 Literature and the A Class Anthropologists tell us that stories, myths, and narratives are an important part of cultural transmission in non-literate indigenous societies. In addition, we’ve just been plain addicted to stories for a long time. As Jonathan Gottschall has suggested, “even when the body goes to sleep, the mind stays up all night, telling itself stories.”12 Stories like The Three Little Pigs are easy to compose and recite orally. We’ve managed to compose some pretty significant stories without exographics. For example, consider the Homerian epics. In the absence of writing, how do I compose a story that takes three days to tell? For that matter, how do I remember it so I can recite it? This was exactly the prob- lem Homer faced in ancient Greece. The Odyssey is over 12,000 lines, so to compose it and perform it orally requires a significant memory. I had always thought that the Odyssey and Iliad were written down to be read by an ancient Greek literate audience. However, it is now accepted by classicists that they were performed orally for centuries before they were written down. Poets would travel settlement to settlement reciting them, say at a religious festival. However, they did not recite a word-for-word rendition but rather gave an improvisation of the stories. The Harvard classicist Milman Parry (1902–1935 CE) did the initial detective work on the oral nature of the epics.13 He argued that the structure of the poems is oral-formulaic. That is, the poet delivering the epic had a stock collection of words and phrases that he selected from given the constraint that he had to keep within the poem’s fixed meter (dactylic hexameter). For instance, if he had to refer to Achilles, he might say “fleet-footed Achilles” or “brave Achilles” or just “Achilles” depending on how much metrical room he had left in a line. Parry believed the poets had vast repertoires of stock words and phrases that they could call upon when improvising the poems. In this way, some classicists have argued that these poets were closer to assembly line workers than to artists. To support his argument, Parry and his student, Albert Lord, studied the compositional methods of illiterate Serb-Croatian epic singers over the period 1933–1935. Again, they found the same oral-formulaic structure that the Homeric epics exhibited. Unfortunately, Parry was not able to participate in the completion of this research as he died in a car acci- dent at age 33. However, Lord continued and reported their results in a wonderful book, The Singer of Tales.14 12 Jonathan Gottschall, The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human (New York: Houghton Miflin Harcourt, 2012). 13 A summary of Parry’s work can be found in a volume edited by his son, Adam Parry: The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987). 14 Albert Lord, The Singer of Tales (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1960). Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class 85 These examples suggests that we can compose and recite significant stories without exo- graphics. But it’s not easy. Being able to write down a narrative makes it much easier to compose and recite. Once the Greeks were in possession of their writing system, the work of story-tellers got a lot easier and, as a result, ancient Greek poetry and drama flourished. I will give a complete documentation of what the ancient Greeks did in the A Class in Chapter 15. Today, hundreds of thousands of novels are published each year. Exographics was the great tool we needed to feed our addiction to stories. 4.6 The Contrast with C Class Ideation We certainly do some outstanding C Class ideation in our advanced literate societies. Exam- ples include many tools, Edison’s light bulb, Velcro, Scotch tape, and soy-based hamburgers. However, the real masters at C Class ideation are the indigenous oral societies. If you look at how they’ve been able to survive in some pretty severe climates, you see right away that they are able to innovate remarkably and then share those ideas culturally. Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich (BRH) have done some very impor- tant work on the role of C Class ideation and culture in primitive societies.15 Here I’d like to present some of their work to make this point. One part of their argument is that we’ve been able to settle the planet, something no other species has been able to do. As we came out of Africa some 50,000 years ago and headed to more northern climates in Europe and Asia, there was a lot of adjustment required. We figured out tailored clothing, fire, and the require- ments of hunting in these new locales, some of which were quite different than equatorial Africa where we came from. To give some idea of the knowledge required, BRH describe how the Inuit were able to settle in the Arctic. One of the problems in the Arctic is the extreme weather. Monthly average winter tem- peratures range between −25 °C and −35 °C. Besides that, it’s very windy making the tem- perature seem that much colder. In this cold, one needs good footwear, pants, and parkas. Here is BRH’s description of their tailoring: The best were made from caribou skins harvested in the fall. Caribou skins insulate better than seal or polar bear fur because the individual hairs have an unusual air-filled structure, something like bubble wrap. Caribou skins harvested in autumn have fur that is just the right thickness. Hides were repeatedly stretched, scraped, moistened, and then stretched again to yield pliable skins. Parkas were assembled from multiple pieces to create a bell shape that captures heat, while also allowing moisture to dissipate when the hood is thrown back. Hoods were ruffed with a strip of fur taken from a wolverine’s shoulders because its variable length makes it easier to clear the hoarfrost. Winter footwear was constructed 15 Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich, J. “The Cultural Niche: Why Social Learning is Essential for Human Adaptation,” PNAS 108(Suppl 2) (2011): 10918–10925. 86 Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class with many layers: first the alirsiik, fur-lined caribou stockings, then the ilupirquk, short lightweight stockings with the fur outside, then a pair of pinirait, heavier stockings with the fur to the outside, then kamiik, boots with the fur outside, and finally tuqtuqutiq, short heavy double-soled boots of caribou skin. Clothing was stitched together with fine thread made from sinew taken from around the vertebrae of caribou. The sinew had to be cleaned, scraped, shredded, and twisted to make thread. Several different kinds of stitches were used for different kinds of seams. A complicated double stitch was used to make footwear waterproof. To make these stitches, Central Inuit women used fine bone needles that made holes that were smaller in diameter than the thread.16 All of that is C Class ideation and very sophisticated C Class ideation. How would you ever figure out that the caribou sinew had to be altered significantly to make thread? Let’s look at one more example. Before the Inuit used European rifles on the hunt, they used bows and arrows. The difficulty with making a bow in the Arctic is that there are no trees. They had to be crafted from driftwood and antlers. Here is the nature of the problem as BRH describe it: . . . they made short bows and used every bowyer’s trick to increase their power. A bow can be made more powerful by adding wood to the limbs. However, making the bow thicker increases the stress within the bow, leading to catastrophic and dangerous failure. This problem is exacerbated in short bows because the curvature is greater. Instead, the Inuit made bows that were thin front to back, wide near the center, and tapering toward the tips. These bows were also recurved, meaning that the unbraced bow formed a backward “C” shape. Bracing the bow leads to a compound curve, a geometry that stores more potential energy. Finally, the Inuit constructed a unique form of composite bow. When a bow is bent, the back (the side away from the archer) is stretched, whereas the belly (the side closer to the archer) is compressed. Wood, horn, and antler are stronger in compression than tension, so the ability of a bow to sustain strong bending forces can be enhanced by adding a material that is strong in tension to the back of the bow. In central Asia and western North America, sinew was glued to the back of the bow to strengthen short bows for use on horseback. The Inuit lashed a woven web of sinew to the backs of their bows, probably because they had no glues that would work in the moist, cold conditions of the arctic. Again, a lot more sophisticated C Class ideation on just one minor aspect of Inuit lifeways. As with the ideation I’ve already discussed, these solutions are worked out over time with many individuals contributing to the solution. 16 Boyd, Richerson and Henrich, “The Cultural Niche,” 10919. Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class 87 A final example of Inuit culture comes from the book Hunters of the Northern Ice by anthropologist Richard Nelson.17 The Inuit depend on their seal harvest for food, clothing (skins), heating (the blubber), and for making traditional tools (from bone and sinew). For this reason, they need to understand the environment close to the sea. Nelson explains it this way: Kayak hunting and ice hunting share the fact that the hunter is operating on a moving surface. Unlike solid land it is a permeable surface through which he may pass rapidly and disastrously. Not only is the surface on which the Eskimo may spend some one-fourth of his life constantly moving, it also lacks the gross complexity of most other geographic zones. The visual cues are small, consisting of subtle changes in the colour of the ice, of small patches of snow which reveal wind direction and force, of water texture and slight indications of tidal changes and currents. Even these minimal cues may be obscured by fog, snow, wind, rain, glare, darkness, and the low level contrasts that camouflage the animal as well. Nelson spends the first five chapters of his book (132 pages) describing the intricacies of the dangers this environment presents. With changing sea currents, wind, and weather, Inuit hunters must be good meteorologists and understand the implications of that weather for the changing condition of the sea ice. This is clearly a knowledge that has built up over centuries and all hunters need it. Finally, I’ll mention a couple of BRH’s “lost European explorer” examples. One of these is the Franklin Expedition which departed England in 1845 to discover the Northwest Pas- sage. Eventually the two ships of the expedition froze in the ice near King William Island. All expedition members perished for several reasons including hypothermia, starvation, and scurvy. Yet, at the time, the Netsilik Inuit people had flourished in this inhospitable land- scape for at least a millennium. Why is it that the Netsilik could survive but not the Franklin Expedition members? The clear answer is culture. The Netsilik had figured out how to sur- vive in that climate. But the Europeans, even with access to the Netsilik, were not able to. Another example is the ill-fated 19th century Burke-Wills expedition across Australia. Some of the leaders of this expedition were separated from the main group and ended up near Cooper’s Creek in desperate need of food. The local tribe shared their method for how to make a flour called nardoo from a local plant in good supply. The nardoo could be used in various kinds of baking and supplied plenty of calories. But unfortunately, the explorers didn’t follow the exact preparation instructions which basically required them to first make a watery paste of crushed seeds. As a result, they did not rid the plant of a toxin which even- tually worked on their nervous systems to immobilize them. They felt as though they were eating well but they were actually poisoning themselves. All but one died. 17 Richard Nelson, Hunters of the Northern Ice (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1969). 88 Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class If you look closely at indigenous societies, there is substantial evidence that they have the same imaginations we do. What they lack is an exographics capability, one that allows them to take full advantage of their imaginations. I am not arguing that we ought to reach out and give them this capability. We’ve tried that experiment many times, and it tends to fail miserably. Introducing an exographics system to an oral people should be their choice on their terms. I’ll have more to say about this later.","length":33679,"tokens":7405,"chunks":[{"title":"The Structure and Growth of the A Class","content":"The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.

The “we” here is all human cultures. Even though the Ideasphere is a set of ideas, it’s equivalently a collection of cultural objects, including beliefs, concepts, material artifacts, activities, behaviours, etc. I defined the A Class to be all those ideas which required exographics, either directly or indirectly, to discover. As I have argued, exographics allows us to bring abstract concepts into our visual fields where we can manipulate them and mould them into an idea.

That is a difficult problem to do in your head, although you could do some intelligent experimenting. For example, the average of the four numbers has to be pretty close to 484/4 = 121. Furthermore, because the integers are not the same, you know that the lowest one must be below 121, say 120, or 118, or 116.

For my purposes, there is no need to enumerate all of the ideas in the A Class. We simply have to know how the A Class is defined and how to determine whether a particular idea is a member of the A Class. For example, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus could not have been discovered or proved without access to exographics. Consequently, it’s in the A Class. The James Webb Space Telescope is a complex amalgam of technologies that took two decades and $10 billion to construct.

In this regard, Claudio Tennie, Josep Call, and Michael Tomasello have argued: Regardless of whether chimpanzee and human culture share some common mechanisms, which they almost certainly do, what is undeniable, we would claim, is that human culture is an evolutionarily unique phenomenon. Prima facie evidence of this uniqueness is the kind of products human cultures produce: material and symbolic artefacts from industrialized technologies to language, to money and to symbolic mathematics.

Yes, other species do C class ideation, but none of these do A Class ideation. 4.2 The Structure of the A Class We are adding to the Ideasphere and A Class daily.

It’s a collection of antecedent technologies including: a high- quality digital camera, a GPS system, a high-speed data modem to connect to the Internet, a touchscreen interface, SIM cards that give each phone a unique identity, and a host of other technologies including just about a limitless supply of apps.

If we look at the history of every bit of tech- nology in the smart phone, a lot of it could be traced to early abstract ideas in science, engineer- ing, and mathematics. Take for example, the smart phone GPS system. The mathematics and physics are straightforward, but someone had to sit down and work through these fundamental calculations, calculations that require exographics.

But he was not the first to think about the concept. The impetus for its invention goes back to the turn of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, a change powered largely by coal. Coal mines were very dangerous places to work. At that time, candles were used for light- ing and sometimes these caused “firedamp” (a mixture of methane and air found largely in coal mines) to explode. Ninety-two men and boys died in the explosion at Felling colliery on 78 Chapter 4 The Structure and Growth of the A Class May 25, 1812, and there were numerous other accidents.","content_length":809,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Structure and Growth of the A Class","content":"About this time a number of scien- tists—William Clanny, Humphry Davy, and George Stephenson—began to work indepen- dently on the problem of lighting in mines in order to reduce the risk of explosion.

In a Royal Society paper, the device was described this way: For the purpose of preventing such accidents, Dr. Clanny has contrived to insulate a candle, by water placed both above and below the lantern in which it is contained. The air, which is intended to support the flame, is supplied by means of a pair of common bellows, by which it is forced through the water beneath the flame; and it is again emitted, after having supported the combustion, by a bent tube that passes into water from the top of the lantern.","content_length":845,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Structure and Growth of the A Class","content":"In consequence of this arrangement, if the air of the mine becomes liable to inflame, the explosion will be confined to the mere content of the lantern, of which only a small part will be consumed, unless the quantity of inflammable gas be very suddenly increased.2 The idea is to light a flame in a space surrounded by glass to limit the risk of an explosion. About this same time, Humphry Davy was running current through narrow carbon fibers to produce light. Eventually he also produced an enclosed lamp, the Davy Lamp, that also limited the risk of explosion in mines.

As Jonathan Gottschall has suggested, “even when the body goes to sleep, the mind stays up all night, telling itself stories.”12 Stories like The Three Little Pigs are easy to compose and recite orally. We’ve managed to compose some pretty significant stories without exographics. For example, consider the Homerian epics. In the absence of writing, how do I compose a story that takes three days to tell? For that matter, how do I remember it so I can recite it? This was exactly the prob- lem Homer faced in ancient Greece.

The Harvard classicist Milman Parry (1902–1935 CE) did the initial detective work on the oral nature of the epics.13 He argued that the structure of the poems is oral-formulaic.

In this way, some classicists have argued that these poets were closer to assembly line workers than to artists. To support his argument, Parry and his student, Albert Lord, studied the compositional methods of illiterate Serb-Croatian epic singers over the period 1933–1935.

One part of their argument is that we’ve been able to settle the planet, something no other species has been able to do. As we came out of Africa some 50,000 years ago and headed to more northern climates in Europe and Asia, there was a lot of adjustment required. We figured out tailored clothing, fire, and the require- ments of hunting in these new locales, some of which were quite different than equatorial Africa where we came from.

Caribou skins insulate better than seal or polar bear fur because the individual hairs have an unusual air-filled structure, something like bubble wrap. Caribou skins harvested in autumn have fur that is just the right thickness. Hides were repeatedly stretched, scraped, moistened, and then stretched again to yield pliable skins.

A complicated double stitch was used to make footwear waterproof. To make these stitches, Central Inuit women used fine bone needles that made holes that were smaller in diameter than the thread.16 All of that is C Class ideation and very sophisticated C Class ideation. How would you ever figure out that the caribou sinew had to be altered significantly to make thread? Let’s look at one more example. Before the Inuit used European rifles on the hunt, they used bows and arrows. The difficulty with making a bow in the Arctic is that there are no trees.

A bow can be made more powerful by adding wood to the limbs. However, making the bow thicker increases the stress within the bow, leading to catastrophic and dangerous failure. This problem is exacerbated in short bows because the curvature is greater. Instead, the Inuit made bows that were thin front to back, wide near the center, and tapering toward the tips. These bows were also recurved, meaning that the unbraced bow formed a backward “C” shape. Bracing the bow leads to a compound curve, a geometry that stores more potential energy. Finally, the Inuit constructed a unique form of composite bow. When a bow is bent, the back (the side away from the archer) is stretched, whereas the belly (the side closer to the archer) is compressed.","content_length":878,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Structure and Growth of the A Class","content":"Wood, horn, and antler are stronger in compression than tension, so the ability of a bow to sustain strong bending forces can be enhanced by adding a material that is strong in tension to the back of the bow.

The Inuit lashed a woven web of sinew to the backs of their bows, probably because they had no glues that would work in the moist, cold conditions of the arctic. Again, a lot more sophisticated C Class ideation on just one minor aspect of Inuit lifeways.

Nelson explains it this way: Kayak hunting and ice hunting share the fact that the hunter is operating on a moving surface. Unlike solid land it is a permeable surface through which he may pass rapidly and disastrously. Not only is the surface on which the Eskimo may spend some one-fourth of his life constantly moving, it also lacks the gross complexity of most other geographic zones.","content_length":777,"content_tokens":162,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Structure and Growth of the A Class","content":"The visual cues are small, consisting of subtle changes in the colour of the ice, of small patches of snow which reveal wind direction and force, of water texture and slight indications of tidal changes and currents.

Nelson spends the first five chapters of his book (132 pages) describing the intricacies of the dangers this environment presents.

Shakespeare, from The Tempest About six million years ago, we were an arboreal ape. In about a nano-second of evolutionary time, we evolved into what we are today, a big-headed primate capable of astonishing feats of the imagination. In this chapter, I’ll present a brief overview of our natural history in an evolutionary context. The story is not so much about our individual imaginations but rather the cognitive abilities and cultural tools (including language and exographics) we’ve evolved to network these imaginations. 5.1 How Evolution Works Based on a genealogical study of the Old Testament, James Ussher (1581–1656 CE), Arch- bishop of Armagh, Primate of All Ireland and professor at Trinity College Dublin fixed the date for the creation of man at October 23, 4004 BC, at 9 am.1 Others, including Issac Newton, have looked to the Bible to fix the date of creation. Certainly, Christianity had a powerful hold on the West well into the 19th century. The conventional wisdom was that all species were the result of a single act of creation with some adaptation by individual species over time. Charles Darwin (1809–1882 CE) thought otherwise. In The Origin of Species (1859), he suggested that all species were the direct descendants of the first living thing. By implica- tion, humans were related to plants, trees, and monkeys. This is reflected in one of Darwin’s 1 The title of his paper outlining the argument is “Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world, the chronicle of Asiatic and Egyptian matters together produced from the beginning of historical time up to the begin- nings of Maccabees.” 89 90 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation notebook diagrams, the so-called “Tree of Life” diagram, one of the most famous in all of science: This was a revolutionary idea that challenged the religious dogma that ours was a magical birth in the image and likeness of the Creator. Our classification system for living things has its origins in the work of Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778 CE). At the most fundamental level is the species defined as the largest group in which two group individuals can produce fertile offspring. For instance, when a dog and cat mate, there is rarely progeny much less fertile progeny. So, dogs and cats are different species. On the other hand, a Great Dane and a Chihuahua can produce fertile progeny and are therefore the same species. Our species’ name is sapiens. Sometimes you see the phrase Homo sapiens. The “Homo” part of that label is our genus, the classification group one step higher than species. The class above genus is called an order. We are members of the primate order along with the great apes, monkeys, and lemurs. We know that species come and go. For example, the fossil record tells us that dinosaurs once roamed the earth but are now extinct. In fact, the list of extinct species is huge. As for origination, imagine that two groups of the same species become separated geographically. Over time, one of these might adapt to its new environment in a much different way than the other. Over enough time, the morphological change might be significant enough that the two populations could not produce fertile progeny and hence a new species would be born. Natural Selection We all have a blueprint for how we’re to be made and this plan is contained in a chemical compound called DNA, a copy of which is contained in every cell of our bodies. Each copy has about 3 billion base pairs and each base pair is either guanine (G) and cytosine (C) or adenine (A) and thymine (T). One G is always paired with a C and an A is always paired with a T. Charles Darwin, First diagram of an evolutionary tree from his First Notebook on Transmutation of Species (1837) Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 91 A gene constitutes a contiguous stretch of adjacent base pairs along a DNA strand. The gene’s sequence of base pairs is the code/blueprint to build a particular protein and these pro- teins are effectively the raw material that our bodies are made of. Within a group of individu- als of the same species, it is not true that all of us have the same base pairs along a particular gene. Each different copy of the gene is called an allele. The human genome is the name given to our 20,000+ genes and they essentially deter- mine our phenotype, a term referring to our observable characteristics (the colour of our eyes and hair, our height, the pigment of our skin, etc.) including our behavior. Our phenotype is largely determined at birth. We inherit a set of genes from each of our parents and it is pos- sible for parents to contribute a different allele for a particular gene. Which of these alleles turns out to be the active one, the one used to construct a gene’s protein, is a complex story. Suffice it to say that our active genetic material, the material determining our phenotype, is a mix of the genetic material from each parent. The process whereby each parent contributes his/her genetic material to offspring occurs in the following way. For the female, the DNA is copied (base pair by base pair) and this copy ends up in an egg. The same is true for the male in the formation of a sperm cell. When a sperm cell joins with an egg cell, the DNA from both parents is linked, and by the process of cell division, the fertilized egg begins to build the proteins required to produce a mature individual. But sometimes “mistakes” happen in the copying process. In particular, mistakes are possible in the base sequence making up a gene. When this happens, a new allele could come into existence. These errors occur most frequently in the creation of the male sperm cell and female egg cell but they can also occur in non-sex cells at any point in the life of an organ- ism. A gene which is the result of a copying mistake is termed a mutation and it is an allele of the original gene. Mutations can have a number of effects on phenotype. In most cases, the allele produced by the mutation is neutral in which case the phenotype is unaffected. In others, a different phenotype obtains. Such phenotypes can either be disadvantageous or advantageous depend- ing on the organism’s environment. For example, some mutations lead to serious health con- ditions. There are others that enhance fitness. Between 4 and 5 percent of mutations are harmful and only about 0.5% are beneficial. The rest are neutral. Let’s consider the classic example of the peppered moth. Basically, there are two colours of this moth, white and black. In England, the earliest existence of the black moth was noted in 1811 CE. At that time, with the Industrial Revolution in full swing, buildings in urban areas were becoming darker as a result of industrial pollution. In this setting, the black moths were less likely to be eaten by the birds that preyed on them because of the camouflage of the soot-stained buildings. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the white peppered moth. Subsequently, when the buildings were cleaned up, the white moth reappeared. So, what is going on here? By mutation, an allele resulting in the black phenotype came into existence. Because of the natural camouflage against the black buildings, these black 92 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation moths had a better chance of surviving to produce offspring. As a result, with successive generations, the percentage of black moths in the population grew, eventually dominating the moth population. By the same reasoning, once the buildings were cleaned up, the white moth reappeared.2 This example illustrates the essence of evolution by natural selection. A mutation leads to an allele, which results in a phenotype that is fitter than others in a given environment. This new phenotype prospers and survives to reproduce more of the same phenotype. The FOXP2 gene plays a critical role in the development of human language circuits in the brain. Its role was first discovered in the study of the difficulty that some members of the KE family (London) had with language. Those family members having the difficulty had trouble forming the past tense (adding “ed” to verbs) and the plural (adding an “s”). This no doubt had something to do with the fact that they suffered from a condition called orofacial dyspraxia which makes it very difficult to control the muscles of the lower face which are crucial for language delivery. Interestingly, the afflicted family members had similar IQs relative to the general population. Researchers ultimately determined that family members having the condition had inherited a FOXP2 allele that only differed by a couple of base pairs from the normal FOXP2 gene. So, slight changes in a gene can have a huge effect on phenotype. Genes make up only about 1.5% of our DNA material. The rest of the material, our so-called epigenetic material—our genetic “dark matter”—is thought to be responsible for, among other things, the regulation of gene activity. Basically, epigenetics is the name given to the study of any phenotype change that is not the result of modification of the genome. Epigenetics is in its infancy. It’s now clear that epigenetic changes can be caused by the envi- ronment as well as mutation. Hence, we have that nurture can affect nature. Let’s summarize. Each species is subject to a built-in experimental process—evolution by natural selection—to help it cope with changes in the environment. Gene mutations can result in new alleles which may lead to a phenotype which has better fitness in the new envi- ronment. If so, it is more likely that these individuals will survive to reproduce and gradually, through reproduction, the allele will gain a foothold in the gene-pool (the genes of all the individuals in a species). As I’ve already suggested, the title of Richard Dawkins’s book, The Blind Watchmaker, is a good metaphor for evolution. He begins the preface this way: This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. 2 This example has an interesting history. Bernard Kettlewell has been accused of fraudulent research as claimed in Judith Hooper’s book (An Evolutionary Tale of Of Moths and Men: The Untold Story of Science and the Peppered Moth, Nor- ton, New York, 2002). The example was revisited by biologist Michael Majerus but he died before he was able to publish his results. Subsequently, Cook et al. (“Selective Bird Predation on the Peppered Moth: the Last Experiment of Michael Majerus,” Biology Letters 8, (2012): 609–612) published Majerus’s work which validates the original example. Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 93 Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet.3 I take a different view. In my estimation, evolution might be the cleverest idea any scientist has ever offered. It’s ingenious. In my reading of the literature, every time a scientist comes up with an answer to a question, there are more questions and usually these are deeper and more difficult to answer than the phrase “add footnotes’’ suggests. Consider this idea. Let’s not allow ourselves to suppose that there is some supreme being responsible for creation. Then, to me, it’s a very interesting question as to how nature came up with evolution. We know that the earth could not support life 4.6 billion years ago and in the interim, somehow, we got here. What did the first life-forms look like? Were they a single cell? Did they have something close to DNA? To me, it’s mind-boggling how you go from complex chemicals, a primordial swamp, and a dash of lightening to a one-celled microbe capable of reproduc- ing itself. And then, how do you go from one-celled life-forms to many-celled forms, each with a chemical plan to remake itself? Not only that, but life-forms capable of composing Eine Kleine Nachtmusik? The questions are endless and fascinating. We still have work to do to understand the natural history of our creation. My guess is that, over time, a series of scientists will present major theories that contribute immensely to our understanding of how stardust produces life. Sure, there will be footnotes along the way but there are also going to be great root ideas added to our understanding. 5.2 Crucial Steps to Imagination Evolutionary biologists tell us that our ancestors split with the ancestors of chimpanzees about 6–8 million years ago. The standard picture of our evolution is the one with the chimpanzee on the left and then progressing through to various body types that are larger and stand more erect until we get to modern man walking upright on the right. Based on this picture, one might think that we descended from chimpanzees. That’s incorrect. About 6 million years ago, our ancestors and the ancestors of chimpanzees were the same species. We don’t know what that ancient species looked like or how it behaved but it was almost certainly a tree-dwelling ape. It appears that we also shared a common ancestor with an extinct genus, Australopithecus, about 3–4 million years ago. There is evidence that Australopithecus was bipedal. Discovered in Tanzania, it’s basically a set of footprints covering 25 meters known as the “Laetoli Tracks.” The steps were taken in an upright walking position and are about 3.7 million years old. They look to have been taken in muddy volcanic ash which later hardened to preserve the evidence. In 1974, archeologists discovered about 40% of the skeleton of an Australopithecus mature female who they named “Lucy.” They dated her to about 3.2 million years ago. What 3 Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design (New York: Norton, 1986), xiii. 94 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation remains of her skeleton suggests that she walked upright. What is most interesting is that she did not have a large cranial cavity and her jaw and teeth were closer to those of a modern chimpanzee than to a modern human. Based on this evidence, it appears that our ancestors were bipedal long before they developed larger brains. After that, about 2.1 million years ago, the Homo genus appeared beginning with Homo habilis (2.1 to 1.5 million years ago) and after that, Homo erectus (1.9 to 0.5 million years ago). We typically refer to these ancestors as “hominins” meaning that they were the Homo genus but not yet Homo sapiens. Homo sapiens first appeared about 300,000 years ago in Africa so we are a relatively young species.4 By comparison, the horseshoe crab is estimated to be about 450 million years old. Bipedalism Today we are the only bipedal primate species. All the others employ a knuckle-walk (walk- ing on all fours) when they move over open ground, although orangutans, chimpanzees, and gorillas are capable of an awkward bipedalism. Our bodies have evolved for bipedal move- ment. We have much longer legs and feet without the opposable big toe so useful to the other great apes for arboreal movement. In addition, our feet, hips and knees have evolved to sup- port bipedal movement. Based on the fossil record, our ancestor species likely maintained an ability to move in trees and over ground well into the period over which Australopithecus lived. It was only with the arrival of the early Homo species (Homo habilis and Homo erectus) that we went to upright walking for good. Bipedalism confers two obvious advantages. The first is that it frees up our hands to do things like carry food and work with tools. The second, it takes less energy to move, a point that modern physiological research makes clear. In one experiment, researchers measured the energy required for four humans to walk 1 kilometer and then for five chimpanzees to knuckle-walk 1 kilometer.5 The average chim- panzee energy consumption per kilogram of weight was almost 4 times what the humans required. This experiment also makes clear that we would have had to have evolved a different body to have bipedal walking produce this energy saving. The modern great apes are ill-suited for bipedal movement. Even for us, bipedal movement is a very delicate manoeuvre. It’s been labelled “controlled falling” by some physiologists—each foot hits the ground just in time to save us from falling over. The central nervous system has to control and sequence a number of critical body movements, particularly in the lower limbs to maintain balance and movement. Any physiological issue makes unassisted movement difficult. For example, for some older people, it’s very difficult to walk without falling so 4 Ewen Callaway, “Oldest Homo Sapiens Fossil Claim Rewrites Our Species’ History,” Nature, June 7, 2017, doi: 10.1038/ nature.2017.22114. 5 See Michael Sockol, David Raichlen, and Herman Pontzer, “Chimpanzee Locomotor Energetics and the Origin of Human Bipedalism,” PNAS 104, no. 30, (2007): 12266. Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 95 some sort of aide like a cane or walker is required. Even when healthy pedestrians move across a different surface, say ice, they have to walk with much shorter steps to maintain balance and not slip and fall. A difficulty with our bipedal movement is that we’re not very quick relative to quadru- peds who, no doubt, saw and see us as a meal. Along with bipedal movement, we evolved very efficient sweat gland systems for cooling relative to other mammals. When we perspire, we produce a liquid on the skin surface and when this liquid evaporates, it draws energy away from the body causing us to cool. The Hand Charles Darwin, in The Descent of Man (1871), wrote this: “Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to act in obedience to his will.” As we’ve seen, the hands are critical to thinking. The human hand comprises 27 bones, over 30 muscles, and a nerve network which con- nects to over 3,000 touch receptors in each fingertip. To say the least, our hands have an expansively intricate structure. Relative to the other non-human primates, we have a much longer thumb and shorter non-thumb digits. One of the key characteristics of our hands is a muscled, opposable thumb. I can take my thumb and touch the tip of each of my other four fingers, something non-human primates cannot do. Our hands seem to have evolved in response to selective pressure for manipulation rather than grasping (as a tree-dwelling ape would require). Indeed, when it comes to manip- ulation and movement, the human hand is astonishingly nimble. To see this, have a look at any video of Joshua Bell playing the violin. For that matter, look at any neurosurgeon, magi- cian, or professional hockey player. They all do incredible things with their hands. Moreover, these hand movements are done without much conscious control. When I drive a car, I make extensive use of my hands to control the car’s direction through the steering wheel but I don’t need to think about these movements. I do them almost instinctively. As it turns out, we require as much of our primary motor cortex to run a thumb as we do a leg. Certainly, we have more intricate hand movements than our primate relatives. There is one particularly good video of a chimp helping a human bake cupcakes.6 It is clear from this film that the chimp has trouble with basic kitchen movements like cracking an egg and mixing batter. This is primarily because his hands have such a short thumb relative to very long digits. They are clearly more suited to climbing in trees than for executing fundamental human kitchen maneuvers. In the film, you can also see the chimp’s short, opposable “big” toe. Again, this foot that has evolved for arboreal movement rather than terrestrial movement. It is likely that our hand evolved the way it did as a result of selective pressure for tool- making and tool use. In a subsequent section, I’ll look at stone tool manufacture which our ancestors started to do about 2.5 million years ago. Bipedalism and our hands allow us to 6 See https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=p_BZa3x4T7Y. 96 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation throw and club with considerable force. Throwing and clubbing require a total body com- mitment and certainly a hand with a fully opposable thumb. Again, if throwing and clubbing were important for survival, there would be selective pressure for these traits.7 Big Brains Our brains have increased in size substantially over the last 3 million years whereas those of chimpanzees have not. Recent genetic evidence suggests that chimpanzees have evolved more quickly than humans but this evolutionary pressure has not acted on the size of a chimp’s brain. Australopithecus afarensis had a brain about 1/3 the size of a modern human brain. Over time, through the period of Homo habilis, then Homo erectus, and then modern humans, brains got increasingly larger. What really got large was our neocortex, the outer region of the brain responsible for our advanced cognitive function. Interestingly, a modern human brain is about 2% of our body weight yet it takes about 25% of our caloric energy input to operate. What is elusive is an explanation of why this happened. There are three theories. One is based on ecology: the cognitive challenges of hunting and gathering were selective for larger brains. Another is social: the cognitive requirements to interact with others (both cooperatively and competitively) selected for larger brains. Finally, cultural: the cognitive skill to generate and accumulate knowledge selected for larger brains. To me, all these theories make sense. Variation in Facial Look If you look at the faces of other animals, it’s difficult to tell them apart by their facial fea- tures. I wouldn’t be able to tell one crow from another. With humans, it’s a different story. There is substantial variation in our facial characteristics relative to the rest of our bodies. It would be very difficult to differentiate people from the neck down. The variation in our facial features makes it easier for us to identify each other. It turns out that the genes known to determine our facial features are much more variable than most of our other genes and it’s this variation which leads to our unique facial features. Effectively, our faces serve as the genetic equivalent of name tags. Interestingly, there is an effect called the cross-race bias, the tendency to recognize more easily the faces of one’s own race. If you are Caucasian, as I am, it is much easier to differ- entiate Caucasian faces from, say, Chinese faces whereas the Chinese find it much easier to differentiate Chinese faces than Caucasian. There is experimental support for this effect. A study examined the results of 231 actual photographic line-ups, the sort used by the police to identify criminal suspects. In cross-race lineups, only 45% of the criminals were correctly identified whereas in same-race lineups, 60% were correctly identified.8 7 On this point, see Richard Young, “Evolution of the Human Hand: the Role of Throwing and Clubbing,” Journal of Anatomy 202, no. 1 (2003): 165–166. 8 Nicholas Shakeshaft and Robert Plomin, “Genetic Specificity of Face Recognition,” PNAS 112, no. 41, (2015). Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 97 Most of us have a good facility for facial recognition. We might forget names but rarely a face. However, some people suffer from prosopagnosia, a condition where they are not able to recognize familiar faces including their own. Generally, people with this condition suffer no impairment of visual functioning or intelligence deficiency. I’ve already suggested that one of our great strengths is our ability to collaborate. There- fore if collaboration is important, it’s not a surprise that selection pressures would favour an ability to differentiate one another easily. The Colouring of the Human Eye Humans have a distinctive eye colouring. The visible eye comprises the iris (the circular coloured part in the middle) and the sclera (the white background). Most other animals don’t have this distinctive sclera. If they have one at all, it’s usually coloured. Experimental evidence suggests that human infants are more likely to follow eye move- ments rather than head movements, whereas chimpanzees and bonobos are more likely to follow head movements.9 The cooperative eye hypothesis proposes that our eyes evolved their distinctive colouring to make it easier for us to follow another’s gaze. Again, this feature is important to the development of our collaborative skills. 5.3 Early Evidence of C Class Ideation Stone Tool Manufacture The earliest known stone tools, the Oldowan tools, made their appearance about 2.6 mya (million years ago) with Homo habilis. These were first discovered in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by archeologist Louis Leakey in the 1930s. Basically, these were rocks which had been struck with other rocks. By this method, razor sharp flakes were produced.10 These could then be used for such things as butchering a carcass and to crack open bones to get at the marrow, a valuable source of protein and other nutrients.11 Subsequently, our ancestors began to manufacture more sophisticated stone tools, the so-called Acheulean tools. These are a flat two-sided pear-shape and required more work to produce than the Olduvai tools. These date from about 1.7 million years to about 130 thou- sand years ago and are generally associated with Homo erectus. They have been found all over Africa, Europe, and Asia. Levallois reduction is the process of flaking a stone in a particular way. It’s a more complex technology than was used to produce Archeluan tools. A hominin knapper would begin with a larger stone called a “core.” He would begin chipping off small “flakes” 9 Michael Tomasello, Brian Hare, Hagen Leymann, and Josep Call, “Reliance on Head Versus Eyes in the Gaze Following of Great Apes and Human Infants: The Cooperative Eye Hypothesis,” Journal of Human Evolution 52(3): 314–20 10 An excellent video on stone tool making can be found at https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=SrvPOkMs4U4 11 In addition, bones were a good way to store protein for later consumption. 98 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation with a hammer stone. This preparation phase was to get the core to the point where it took a tortoise shell shape. As the preparation phase progressed, the knapper was continually looking for a good “platform” defined to be the point on the side of the stone where, if struck in the right way, would produce a large flake. This flake usually had a serrated, extremely sharp edge which could then be used for cutting and scraping. Once the first large flake was produced, the knapper would start the process again on the same core to produce another large flake.12 On this process, Thomas Wynn and Frederick Coolidge have remarked: This single routine is made up of at least three distinct subroutines— production-surface preparation, platform-surface preparation, and platform preparation. These need not be sequential in time, but they are hierarchical, in the sense that the production-surface preparation takes precedence over the others. There is considerable feedback between the subroutines, and the entire process is dynamic and interactive.13 If you watch expert modern stone knappers doing a Levallois reduction, you can see the dynamic aspect of their decision-making. At each iteration, the knapper surveys the core until he or she finds the right place to strike, the strike is made, and the process begins again. Based on studies of modern stone knapping, there is considerable skill required to do it at an expert level. Almost certainly, there was some transfer of knowledge between novices and experts among our stone-age ancestors. Whether it was “learn by watching and doing” or “learn by listening, watching, and doing,” we don’t know. I suspect the latter but regardless, it’s evidence of cultural transmission that I’ll address later in the book. This fossil record of stone tool ideation—Olduwan to Acheulian to Levallois Reduction— demonstrates significant C Class ideation ability. Ancient Cave Painting Another early evidence of our imaginations is ancient cave art. The oldest such paintings are about 40,000 years old. This skill demonstrates that our ancient ancestors were able to see reality and then represent what they saw. This is quite a feat. They were going from three- dimensional reality to a two-dimensional representation of that reality and to do so requires imagination. By definition, this painting is exographic because these ancient artists were translating their ideas to a two-dimensional medium. It certainly tells us that, cognitively, they were ready to take the step to exographics because modern exographics is the “art” of drawing alphabetic and other symbols on a two-dimensional surface. 12 An excellent demonstration of Levallois technique can be seen here: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=AGkU2lXtQ0Y 13 Thomas Wynn and Frederick Coolidge, “How Levallois Reduction Is Similar to, and Not Similar to, Playing Chess,” in Stone Tools and the Evolution of Human Cognition, eds A. Nowell and I. Davidson, (Boulder: University Press of Colorado, 2011), 83–103. Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 99 The Control of Fire The control of fire was an important step forward for our hominin ancestors. A con- trolled fire provides warmth, lighting, and protection from predators. It also was a first step towards cooking and advanced tool production, both of which provided a huge cul- tural benefit. Estimates of the earliest controlled use of fire range between 1.7 million and 2 million years ago.14 Language As we have seen, our collaborative skill, the ability to mindshare, is really what separates us from other species. One of the cognitive skills that enables this collaboration is language. I’ll have much more to say about language later in the book. Food and Cooking Over the last 3–3.5 million years, we’ve experienced a phenomenal encephalization. We’ve used this additional volume to tremendous advantage, but at a significant cost. Even though our heads are a small percentage of our size, they consume roughly 25% of our caloric input. Our heads are big electro-chemical engines that must be fuelled. Intense periods of thinking require extraordinary amounts of energy. This is most evident with expert chess players during tournaments. The biologist, Robert Sapolsky, has suggested that expert chess players can burn up to 6,000 calories per day when playing tournaments.15 This is about three times what a normal human requires per day, and it seems to be consistent with the weight loss that most world-class players experience when they play tournaments. In an ESPN website article, reporter Aishwarya Kumar quotes the world number 2, Fabiano Caruana: “Sometimes I’ve weighed myself after tournaments and I’ve seen the scale drop below 120”.16 Caruana’s normal weight is 135 pounds. Whatever the cause of the encephalization, our caloric input has been important. It’s dif- ficult to pin down but it’s likely that we began to cook at some point over the period of Homo erectus and, as Richard Wrangham argues, it does some wonderful things to food.17 First, there is the so-called Maillard Reaction, named after the French chemist who discovered it. When meat and other foods are cooked, they brown. For example, raw hamburg is red and, 14 Steven James, “Hominid Use of Fire in the Lower and Middle Pleistocene: A Review of the Evidence,” Current Anthro- pology 30, no. 1, (February 1989). 15 Sapolsky got his information from physiologist Leroy DuBeck and his graduate student, Charlotte Leedy whose PhD thesis was titled “The Effects of Tournament Chess Playing on Selected Physiological Responses in Players of Varying Aspirations and Abilities.” The results of that thesis were briefly summarized in: Charlotte Leedy and Leroy DuBeck, “Physiological Changes During Tournament Chess,” Chess Life and Review, no. 12 (1971): 708. The 6,000 calorie esti- mate is DuBeck’s based on the information in Leedy’s thesis. 16 Aishwarya Kumar, “The Grandmaster Diet: How to Lose Weight While Barely Moving,” Sept 13, 2019, available at: https://www. espn. com/espn/story/_ /id/27593253/why-grandmasters-magnus-carlsen-fabiano-caruana-lose-weight- playing-chess 17 Richard Wrangham, Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human (New York: Basic Books, 2009). 100 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation after it’s been cooked, it takes on a much darker colour. This change in colour is the result of a chemical reaction among the food’s amino acids and reducing sugars. It is also responsible for the enhancement of the food’s taste. Second, cooked food is much easier to masticate and digest and therefore it takes less energy to eat. A good example is a potato. Raw potatoes are harder to eat than boiled potatoes. Third, cooked food is much less likely to cause food poi- soning. Finally, cooked food provides more calories (energy) per unit mass of the food eaten. In short, cooking has provided significant evolutionary advantages. Relative to humans, chimpanzees have enormous teeth and jaw musculature. They are omnivores and spend a lot of time foraging for fruits, seeds, bark, insects and hunting smaller monkeys (mainly red colobus). These food demands require about six hours of work a day for foraging and eating. Relative to a chimpanzee, our teeth are much smaller because our cooked food does not require the chewing that chimpanzee raw food does. Persistence Hunting and Abstraction Until recently, some primitive societies still engaged in persistence hunting.18 This technique requires a small group of hunters to pursue an animal to the point where it is exhausted, can- not run any further, and is then an easy kill. In sub-Saharan Africa, these hunts usually begin around midday when it is hottest. The heat gives humans a significant advantage. The com- bination of our hairless bodies and sweat gland systems enable us to withstand much higher temperatures than mammals can. Mammals cool themselves largely through their mouths by panting and staying out of the sun as much as they can. Generally, they cannot stay cool enough to continually get away from determined humans. There is evidence that Homo erectus engaged in persistence hunting some two million years ago and it is likely that the practice started earlier than that. Some evolutionary biolo- gists have argued that our bipedalism, longer legs, hairless bodies, and cooling systems were all evolutionary adaptations that enabled this kind of hunting. Significantly, our cognitive ability had to evolve to be able to do it. Some hunting was done with bow and poison-tipped arrows. Once these arrows broke the animal’s skin, the poison made its way to the animal’s blood system, and it subsequently died. As James Suzman has suggested, developing lethal poisons which did not make the meat toxic must have involved a lot of unfortunate trial and error.19 In modern hunter-gatherer societies, hunting is a group effort that requires significant skill and knowledge. Louis Liebenberg presents some examples of this. Here is one: While out on a track with him, for example, !Nam!kabe looked at the tracks of a solitary wildebeest of the previous evening and pointed out evidence of trampling, 18 Louis Leibenberg, “Peristence Hunting by Modern Hunter-Gatherers,” Current Anthropology 47, no. 6 (2006). 19 James Suzman, Affluence Without Abundance (London: Bloomsbury, 2017). Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 101 which indicated that the animal had slept at that spot. He explained that the tracks facing away from the sleeping place had been made early that morning and were therefore relatively fresh. The tracks then followed a straight course, indicating that the animal was on its way to a specific destination. After a while, !Nam!kabe started to investigate several sets of footprints in a particular area. ... He explained that that particular area was the feeding ground of that specific wildebeest. Since it was, by that time, about midday, it could be expected that the wildebeest might be resting in the shade in the near vicinity. !Nam!kabe then followed up the fresh tracks, moving stealthily as the footprints became very fresh, until he spotted the animal in the shade of a tree . . .20 Liebenberg makes the point that the cognition required in this situation and others is effec- tively the same cognition required for science. In the example above, the Bushmen have to hypothesize what the animal is doing given the evidence in the spoor. As Liebenberg argues, this is no different than what a scientist has to do. For example, to explain the motion of heav- enly bodies, Newton chose to invent a force called gravity, one that he couldn’t see but could imagine. The Bushmen are doing the same kind of thinking. Persistence hunting requires abstract thinking. Note, however, that it is not A Class ideation since the A Class requires exographics. The Gods and Abstraction Göbekli Tepe is a fascinating site in northern Mesopotamia. It’s located at the highest point of the Germus mountain range and can be seen from miles away. It contains a set of large monolithic T-shaped columns weighing as many as 8–10 tonnes. The site has the flavour of Stonehenge in England but is much older. Its construction has been dated to about 9,500 BCE. The largest columns are located within a circular stone wall which itself contains regularly spaced smaller columns. As you go further away from what appears to be the center, there are smaller structures containing smaller columns. The columns have various figures sculpted into them, and some of these give the impression the columns are an abstract representation of a human and likely a god. There is no evidence of permanent settlement at Göbekli Tepe. Nor is there evidence of any kind of agriculture or animal husbandry in the immediate local area, although a signifi- cant number of animal bones have been discovered likely as a result of feasting at the site. In fact, it is likely that Göbekli Tepe served as a religious shrine for the hunter-gatherers of the area and perhaps a large area. Let’s put this in perspective. Why would hunter-gatherers have invested the time and energy to build such a shrine? It must have been that their reli- gious belief system had a powerful hold on them. By “religious” I mean a belief in gods 20 Louis Liebenberg, “Tracking Science: The Origin of Scientific Thinking in Our Paleolithic Ancestors,” Skeptic Magazine 18, no. 3 (2013): 19. 102 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation whose actions had significant influence on what happened to the assembled hunter-gatherers. Importantly this is long before writing has been invented and we know that extant oral peo- ples have a strong connection to god-centered belief systems. Oral societies are not able to support out-of-the-box, renegade thinking. Typically, there is a belief system that is culturally transmitted through rites, customs, proverbs, and narratives to the next generation. I can’t imagine that things were too much different in 9,500 BCE. Klaus Schmidt (1953–2014 CE), who began archeological excavations at Göbekli Tepe in 1995, expressed the idea this way: “First the temple, then the city.” I think he’s right. Religious belief still plays a significant role in literate societies today. The long-term trend appears to be that we are moving to more secular societies, but belief remains strong in techno-literate societies. 75% of Americans have some sort of religious belief. I don’t plan to say much about religious belief. We appear to have a biological need to believe in something. We also seem to require some sort of teleological explanation for the way the world works. For example, we believe that gravity is a force that keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun. But what is gravity? How does it work? Are there invisible strings that keep us in orbit? Whatever the reason, our conception of gravity clearly requires belief. This is what’s so interesting about the objections of Richard Dawkins and his merry band of atheists.21 They argue that there is no evidence for a god but, since the Earth continues to revolve around the Sun, a belief in gravity is justified. In other words, their “religion” requires that belief be governed by objective, empirical evidence, the same sort of evidence that led us to do frontal lobotomies based on the pioneering work of Nobel Laureate Egas Moniz.22 5.4 The Agricultural Revolution and the Arrival of Civilization The archeological record is clear that the hominin line (Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Homo sapiens) lived in small bands engaged in a hunter-gatherer subsistence for millions of years. Then, suddenly, over the course of about 6,000 years, we discovered agriculture and started to live in fixed settlements, and then in very large city-states. In an evolutionary minute, we went from hunter-gatherers to civilization. The interesting question is how. I think it’s fair to say that we aren’t anywhere close to a consensus. A part of the reason is that evidence, largely archeological, is limited. There are some things we can say. 21 The so-called New Atheists would also include Sam Harris, Lawrence Krauss, Daniel Dennett, and the late Christopher Hitchens. Dawkins is the informal leader and began a literary genre with his book The God Delusion (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2008). 22 See Robert Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst (New York: Penguin Press, 2017), 9. Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 103 Let’s start with the change in climate that occurred. The following graphic shows how temperature changed over the last 20,000 years: −25 −30 −35 −40 −45 −50 −55 Let me try to explain it. First, it may come as a shock that scientists are able to measure aver- age temperature so accurately that far back in time. But they can and one of the techniques they use is looking at polar ice sheets in regions like Greenland. Each year, when it snows, a new layer of ice forms. Each new layer of ice formed at different temperatures has different chemical properties. Scientists can drill down and get a core of these ice sheets to see how climate varied over time and, as the graphic suggests, they can go back a long way. Now let’s take a closer look at the content of the graphic. Note that the horizontal axis measures time in thousands of years from the present (at the far right at 0). On the left, we have 20 which means 20,000 years ago. The vertical axis measures average temperature (Celsius) in Greenland. These temperatures in Greenland would be highly correlated with those in Mesopotamia. The shaded regions in the middle of the graphic correspond to the demarcation between two long time epochs. The Pleistocene period ran from the deep past to about 12,000 years ago, and the Holocene has been running for about the last 11,000 years. Note that the average temperature in the Holocene is much higher. More importantly, the temperature is much less variable. We know that temperatures dipped over the very recent Little Ice Age (about 1200 CE to 1900 CE) and, according to Jean Grove, this dip reeked havoc with agricultural output.23 Based on these findings and others, Peter Richerson et al. argue that agriculture would have been impossible in the Pleistocene.24 So it was only after the Younger-Dryas period, that agriculture was possible. Another factor is geography. It’s hard to understand the cultural advance in Mesopotamia without first understanding the geography of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is the term given to the area of the Fertile Crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. When I use the term “Mesopotamia,” I’m referring not only to the region, 23 Jean Grove, The Little Ice Age (London: Methuen, 1988). 24 Peter Richerson, Robert Boyd, and Robert Bettinger, “Was Agriculture Impossible during the Pleistocene but Mandatory 20 15 10 5 0 Age (kya) during the Holocene?

The Tigris and Euphrates rivers originate in the mountains of southeastern Turkey. In the spring, with melting snows and rain, the rivers become swollen and pick up silt, a fine dust with grains smaller than sand particles. This silt is rich in nutrients and good for growing crops. The rivers run the length of the Fertile Crescent and when they got to the relatively flat alluvial plains close to the Persian Gulf, they often flooded. This resulted in significant amounts of sediment (rich soil and silt) settling into the existing soil. Over time, the land sur- rounding the rivers became quite fertile. George Cressey has estimated that the Tigris depos- its some 40 million cubic meters of sediment annually and 90% of this goes to the alluvial plains and the amount left by the Euphrates is only marginally smaller.25 Jennifer Pournelle has suggested that the geography of southern Mesopotamia circa 4,000 BCE was quite different than it is now.26 It’s generally agreed that water levels were higher. More importantly the Persian Gulf was quite a bit further north than it currently is. Back then, the ancient settlements of Eridu, Ur, Uruk, and Lagash would have been on or close to the Gulf. Based on extensive research, including a detailed study of satellite images and other informa- tion including estimates from climate cores, Pournelle has suggested that the alluvial area of southern Mesopotamia had a significant area of wetlands where birds, waterfowl, fish and other sources of protein (including some small ungulates) were present. In addition, there was very fertile soil close to the two rivers and, beyond that, rich grazing areas. The area was a veritable Garden of Eden and therefore a sedentary hunter-gatherer existence was possible. How you go from this alluvial flood-plain to an ancient city-state like Uruk in a matter of a few millennia is not easy to explain. It’s estimated that the population of Uruk was 50,000 by 3,000 BCE. The standard narrative, as James Scott describes, is that “Agriculture ... replaced the savage, wild, primitive, lawless, and violent world of hunter-gathers and nomads.”27 He then suggests, tongue in cheek, that No one, once shown the techniques of agriculture, would dream of remaining a nomad or forager. Each step is presumed to represent an epoch-making leap in mankind’s well-being: more leisure, better nutrition, longer life expectancy, and, at long last, a settled life that promoted the household arts and the development of civilization.”28 It didn’t quite go that way, at least initially. One drawback was zoonotic disease. With domesticated animals and humans now living in proximity, it became easier for animal 25 George Cressey, “The Shatt al-Arab Basin,” Middle East Journal 12, no. 4, (1958). 26 Jennifer Pournelle, Marshland of Cities: Deltaic Landscapes and the Evolution of Early Mesopotamian Civilization.

For this reason, Scott refers to these new settle- ments based on grains and livestock as “multispecies resettlement camps.” In addition, a diet based increasingly on agricultural products was deficient in several key nutrients. The combination of these two resulted in a very high infant mortality which Scott estimates to be 40–50%. Finally, let’s come back to religious beliefs and their influence on these new societies. As others have suggested, to understand Mesopotamian city-state rivalry, you must understand the strong influence religious belief had on these peoples. Ashurnasirpal was a king of Assyria (northern Mesopotamia) in the 9th century BCE. His exploits were the result of a “merciless weapon” entrusted to him by the god of Assyria, Ashur, generally described as cruel and warlike. Here is Ashurnasirpal’s description of how he employed Ashur’s “merciless weapon” against Ahiababa: I built a pillar over against the city gate and I flayed all the chiefs who had revolted and I covered the pillar with their skins. Some I impaled upon the pillar on stakes and others I bound to stakes round the pillar. I cut the limbs off the officers who had rebelled. Many captives I burned with fire and many I took as living captives. From some I cut off their noses, their ears, and their fingers, of many I put out their eyes. Wars were a serious undertaking directed by the gods. Each city-state and kingdom had a special class called seers to whom the kings went to get direction about the will of the gods. I think it’s safe to say that the gods and religion played a role in the actions of city-states. All had their own gods, these gods loved a good fight, and the kings and their peoples obliged them. Interestingly, Julian Jaynes wrote an influential book in the 1970s entitled The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. In it, he argued that, prior to 2,000 BCE, our minds were bicameral with two voices, one engaging in conversation with the other. Nobody of significance has repudiated his argument and there is some strong evi- dence from ancient Mesopotamia that he might be right. Sometimes we try to explain state actions on a rational basis with arguments that appeal to politics, national will, and econom- ics. But in ancient Mesopotamia, we need to keep our eye on the gods and religion. Our ancestors’ belief in these ancient gods constitute abstract ideation, and since they were invented long before we came to exographics, they reside in the C Class. 5.5 Gene-Culture Coevolution For the longest time, evolutionary biologists felt that the only force acting on us was bio- logical. That is, mutations sometimes lead to new phenotypes which were better suited to the environment. That view is changing. We are now recognizing that our culture can have substantial effects on our biology. For example, take cooking. When you cook food, you no longer need the massive jaw, teeth, facial musculature, and gastro-intestinal tract that 106 Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation chimpanzees have to masticate and then digest their food. Consequently, we’ve evolved much smaller digestive systems to take in our calories. This is an instance where culture (cooking) has resulted in a massive biological evolutionary change. The terms Dual Inheritance Theory, Biocultural Evolution and Gene-Culture Coevolu- tion all refer to the idea that our phenotype evolves in response to changes in culture as well as changes in genes. In addition to the effects of cooking there are other examples. Scientists have recently found that the Inuit in Greenland have an allele which enables them to produce relatively more brown fat cells which enables the body metabolism to produce more heat when required. No doubt, our ancestors’ ability to produce warm clothes enabled them to settle the Arctic and give rise to this allele. Or consider the Bajau people. These people have fished for thousands of years by diving to the sea-floor for shellfish. As a result, their spleens have evolved to be larger and this allows them to dive for longer periods of time.29 Another example are the alleles which allow us to more easily digest starches and lactose as a result of our shift to farming from a hunter-gatherer existence. Also, populations in climates where malaria is widespread have developed alleles which offer improved malaria resistance. In their book, The 10,000 Year Explosion, Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending argue that human evolution is quickening and they present some good evidence that it is.30 In their last chapter, they make an argument that has some implications for this work. They first establish that Ashkenazi Jews have a much higher IQ than other groups. They go on to argue that, as a result of this group working in professions that required a high degree of intelli- gence over a long period of time (approximately 800 CE to about 1700 CE), this led to a high selection pressure for intelligence. As you might guess, the claim is not without controversy but it’s certainly plausible. 5.6 Dehaene and Learning Stanislas Dehaene has written a very good book on how we learn.31 In the introduction, he raises an important question: why do we have to learn? Why don’t we just come out pro- grammed to do what we do? Just as a springbok calf can run within minutes of being born, why don’t we come out with all of our skills and, in particular, our symbolic skills, those of speaking, reading, and writing? Let’s make sure we know what learning means, particularly in the context of culture. Learning is the transfer of information from one of us to another about some aspect of cul- ture. For example, in primary school, we learn how to read and this is an information transfer from the teacher to students. Adult Inuit teach their adolescents how to sharpen a knife. 29 Melissa Ilardo et al., “Physiological and Genetic Adaptations to Diving in Sea Nomads,” Cell 173, no. 3 (2018). 30 Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution (New York: Basic Books, 2009). 31 Stanislas Dehaene, How We Learn: Why Brains Learn Better Than Any Machine . . . For Now (New York: Penguin Books, 2021). Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 107 He first argues that a pre-wiring of the brain with all of our skills is impossible. We have seen that our design is based on the chemical encoding in our DNA, a complex chemical compound consisting of strings of base pairs. Supposing that each base pair could encode 00, 01, 10, 11 or essentially two bits, the totality of our DNA could hold about 750 mega- bytes, which is about the information you could put onto a small USB stick. That’s not a lot of information. On the other hand, our brains are made up of 86 billion neurons and there are about 1000 trillion connections among them. If we assume that each connection is a bit (a vast underestimate), this translates to a hundred tetrabytes which is about 100,000 times larger than what is encoded on our DNA. Therefore, our brains have tremendous capacity for detail, many times larger than the maximum detail that our DNA can encode. Hence prepro- gramming our brains would be impossible. It’s like our DNA provides us with a computer that we can then program with the “apps” of cognition and knowledge acquisition that we learn over time. He argues that pre-wiring is not desirable because we would not have the flexibility to adjust to the particular environments that each of us faces. Miss Lily, my family’s little Bas- sett hound, has had some unfortunate clashes with Arthur, a Jack Russell, at our local doggie park. She has learned to give Arthur a wide berth. It would have been clearly impossible for Miss Lily to have been born with this pre-wiring. She had to learn it. 5.7 Summary This chapter begins with us as small apes, sitting in the trees. It ends with us at the begin- nings of civilization where we’ve been doing some C Class ideation for a while and our A Class ideation is about to take off. Some fortuitous evolutionary steps gave us imaginations. Bipedal movement freed up our hands and eventually this led to tool manufacture and use. For some reason, our brains grew a lot larger and, no doubt, in the process our imaginations developed and at some point, C Class ideation was possible. Most importantly, we developed the cultural tool of language as well as other cognitive skills to enable us to collaborate on a large scale.","length":56897,"tokens":12620,"chunks":[{"title":"The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation","content":"What’s past is prologue.

Certainly, Christianity had a powerful hold on the West well into the 19th century. The conventional wisdom was that all species were the result of a single act of creation with some adaptation by individual species over time. Charles Darwin (1809–1882 CE) thought otherwise.

Natural Selection We all have a blueprint for how we’re to be made and this plan is contained in a chemical compound called DNA, a copy of which is contained in every cell of our bodies. Each copy has about 3 billion base pairs and each base pair is either guanine (G) and cytosine (C) or adenine (A) and thymine (T) One G is always paired with a C and an A is always paired with a T.","content_length":652,"content_tokens":151,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation","content":"Charles Darwin, First diagram of an evolutionary tree from his First Notebook on Transmutation of Species (1837) Chapter 5 The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation 91 A gene constitutes a contiguous stretch of adjacent base pairs along a DNA strand.

The human genome is the name given to our 20,000+ genes and they essentially deter- mine our phenotype, a term referring to our observable characteristics (the colour of our eyes and hair, our height, the pigment of our skin, etc.) including our behavior.

The process whereby each parent contributes his/her genetic material to offspring occurs in the following way. For the female, the DNA is copied (base pair by base pair) and this copy ends up in an egg. The same is true for the male in the formation of a sperm cell.

A gene which is the result of a copying mistake is termed a mutation and it is an allele of the original gene. Mutations can have a number of effects on phenotype. In most cases, the allele produced by the mutation is neutral in which case the phenotype is unaffected. In others, a different phenotype obtains.

At that time, with the Industrial Revolution in full swing, buildings in urban areas were becoming darker as a result of industrial pollution. In this setting, the black moths were less likely to be eaten by the birds that preyed on them because of the camouflage of the soot-stained buildings. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the white peppered moth. Subsequently, when the buildings were cleaned up, the white moth reappeared. So, what is going on here?

By the same reasoning, once the buildings were cleaned up, the white moth reappeared.2 This example illustrates the essence of evolution by natural selection. A mutation leads to an allele, which results in a phenotype that is fitter than others in a given environment. This new phenotype prospers and survives to reproduce more of the same phenotype.

Interestingly, the afflicted family members had similar IQs relative to the general population. Researchers ultimately determined that family members having the condition had inherited a FOXP2 allele that only differed by a couple of base pairs from the normal FOXP2 gene. So, slight changes in a gene can have a huge effect on phenotype. Genes make up only about 1.5% of our DNA material.

The standard picture of our evolution is the one with the chimpanzee on the left and then progressing through to various body types that are larger and stand more erect until we get to modern man walking upright on the right. Based on this picture, one might think that we descended from chimpanzees. That’s incorrect. About 6 million years ago, our ancestors and the ancestors of chimpanzees were the same species.

There are three theories. One is based on ecology: the cognitive challenges of hunting and gathering were selective for larger brains. Another is social: the cognitive requirements to interact with others (both cooperatively and competitively) selected for larger brains. Finally, cultural: the cognitive skill to generate and accumulate knowledge selected for larger brains. To me, all these theories make sense.

By this method, razor sharp flakes were produced.10 These could then be used for such things as butchering a carcass and to crack open bones to get at the marrow, a valuable source of protein and other nutrients.11 Subsequently, our ancestors began to manufacture more sophisticated stone tools, the so-called Acheulean tools.

This flake usually had a serrated, extremely sharp edge which could then be used for cutting and scraping. Once the first large flake was produced, the knapper would start the process again on the same core to produce another large flake.12 On this process, Thomas Wynn and Frederick Coolidge have remarked: This single routine is made up of at least three distinct subroutines— production-surface preparation, platform-surface preparation, and platform preparation.","content_length":869,"content_tokens":184,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Evolution of Imagination and the Emergence of C Class Ideation","content":"These need not be sequential in time, but they are hierarchical, in the sense that the production-surface preparation takes precedence over the others.

The Tigris and Euphrates rivers originate in the mountains of southeastern Turkey. In the spring, with melting snows and rain, the rivers become swollen and pick up silt, a fine dust with grains smaller than sand particles. This silt is rich in nutrients and good for growing crops. The rivers run the length of the Fertile Crescent and when they got to the relatively flat alluvial plains close to the Persian Gulf, they often flooded. This resulted in significant amounts of sediment (rich soil and silt) settling into the existing soil.

Here is Anna Abraham’s description of imagination: Paul Gauguin This ability to conjure up images, ideas, impressions, intentions, and the like: This is the imagination at work. The conceptual space it spans is stupendously vast, stretching across the real and the unreal, the possible and the impossible. Its workings are spontaneous and deliberate, ordinary and extraordinary, conscious and unconscious, deriving from the outer world external to our bodies as well as our inner world.1 Imagination cuts a wide swath. We know it’s generated by the electro-chemical neuronal network in our heads, but how this network works its magic is not well understood. In this chapter, I’ll cover what we know, and then I’ll relate it to the Ideasphere and ideation. 6.1 Dual Process Theory In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman suggests a dual process theory of thought.2 He posits that we engage in two kinds of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the quick, intuitive, “no-thought” thinking we use to make everyday, relatively unimport- ant decisions like what to wear, what to have for dinner, or what movie to see. On the other hand, System 2 is the slow, deliberate, hard thinking required to get to ideas. Let me differentiate the two types of thinking with a couple of examples. Consider this problem: A ball and bat cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. What does the ball cost? 1 Anna Abraham, “Surveying the Imagination Landscape,” in The Cambridge Handbook of the Imagination, ed. Anna Abraham (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2020), 1. 2 Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011). 109 110 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation Without thinking about it too much, you might estimate that the bat costs $1 and the ball costs $0.10. This seems to make sense because they sum to $1.10. But that answer is wrong. With those costs, the bat costs $0.90 more than the ball which violates the problem condition that the bat costs $1 more. If you came to this solution, you were using System 1 thinking and you answered the same way a large number of Harvard and MIT undergrads have answered. Now suppose I had given you this variation: A ball and bat cost $1.37. The bat costs $0.43 more than the ball. What does the ball cost? With these numbers, a quick solution is really not obvious and you’d have to go right to a System 2 process to solve it. Sigmund Freud (1856–1939 CE) was the first to suggest that we possessed two modes of thought. He referred to a “primary process” (System 1) and a “secondary process” (System 2). Freud felt that our conscious thought, the secondary process, was just the tip of the iceberg with most of our primary process out of our sight. More recent dual process work can be found in papers by Seymour Epstein, Steven Sloman, and Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope.3 Keith Stanovich and Richard West were the first to use the names System 1 and System 2.4 The terms Type 1 process (intuitive) and Type 2 process (deliberative) have also been used. Of some interest is how the two processes interact. To me, the default-interventionist structure proposed by Jonathan Evans makes sense.5 In this model, there is a default System 1 response, and the System 2 process may or may not intervene. For example, a medical doctor might make a System 1 process diagnosis on a patient if the patient’s symptoms are relatively routine and not serious; on the other hand, if the consequences of a poor diagnosis are life- threatening, the doctor will kick in his or her System 2 process. The evolutionary explanation for a dual process is that the System 2 process was a recent addition on top of the more animal-like System 1 process. A number of researchers have objected to dual process theories arguing that we have a single process for thinking and that we can choose how much effort to apply to a particular idea or decision. Wim De Neys has argued that this debate will be difficult to resolve and that we ought to move on.6 Regardless of the nature of our minds, dual process or otherwise, we definitely use a rational, analytic thought process to arrive at significant ideas (System 2). 3 Seymour Epstein, “Integration of the Cognitive and Psychodynamic Unconscious,” American Psychologist 49, no. 8 (1994); Steven Sloman, “The Empirical Case for Two Systems of Reasoning,” Psychological Bulletin 119, no. 1 (1996); Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope, Dual-Process Theories in Social Psychology (New York: Guilford Press, 1999). 4 Keith Stanovich and Richard West, “Individual Differences in Reasoning: Implications for the Rationality Debate?” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 22, no. 5 (2000). 5 Jonathan Evans, “On the Resolution of Conflict in Dual Process Theories of Reasoning,” Thinking & Reasoning 13, no. 4 (2007). 6 Wim De Neys, “On Dual and Single Process Models of Thinking,” Perspectives on Psychological Science 16, no. 6 (2021). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 111 6.2 The Subconscious Among the many aspects of cognitive function, control of what the mind attends to is perhaps the biggest mystery. For interesting research on this topic, the reader is referred to the col- lection of papers in the book edited by Raja Parasuraman7 and the work of Donald Norman and Tim Shallice.8 These researchers pose theories of the way our minds focus, switch, and divide attention. Most suggest that attention is not governed by a single process but rather by several processes that interact. In one, we are conscious of what is happening; in another, our subconscious functions at the same time. All of us have had instances where we suddenly become aware of something important. Several years ago, in Seville, Spain, my wife and I had arranged to meet a taxi at 4:30 a. m. at the gate of the Alcazar to get to the airport to begin the trip back to Canada. We had several pieces of luggage, some carry-on luggage, and my computer. I had been at the University of Seville for a month and the work I had done there was stored on my computer. In the five minutes we spent waiting for the taxi, several groups of young Spaniards passed us. No doubt they were on their way home after a night of revelry as it was “feria” time. The taxi arrived, we loaded, and then headed out onto the streets of Seville which were surprisingly busy for it being so early. We weren’t in the taxi five minutes when I suddenly realized I didn’t have my computer. This was clearly a case where my subconscious brought the issue into my conscious mind. We had a little trouble getting the taxi-driver to turn around because I don’t speak Spanish and he didn’t speak English. We eventually got back to the Alcazar and my computer was sitting where I had left it. There have been other occasions where immi- nent appointments, ones that I hadn’t thought about for days, have suddenly come into my consciousness. What I am most certain about is that I have help from my subconscious when I am focussed on solving a problem, which for me is typically a problem in applied mathematics. Very often I’m uncertain about the next step. When this happens, I will set the problem aside and when doing something unrelated, the start of a solution will come to me. This happens frequently enough for me to think that my subconscious mind continues to work on the prob- lem while my conscious mind is otherwise occupied. There is some empirical support for this position. Benjamin Baird and his colleagues did an interesting experiment where 145 subjects were given an Unusual Uses Task (UUT).9 An UUT is one that purports to measure creativity. An example is “Name alternative uses for a brick.” Possible answers might include: a doorstop, use to break a window, use as a weapon, pounding a nail, etc. Subjects worked at the UUTs for two minutes. For the next 12 minutes, 7 Raja Parasuraman, The Attentive Brain (Cambridge, MIT Press (Bradford), 2000). 8 Donald Norman and Tim Shallice, “Attention to Action: Willed and Automatic Control of Behaviour,” in Consciousness and Self-Regulation: Advances in Research and Theory, eds.

One group did a demanding activity that took their full attention, another was given an undemanding reaction time activity, a third group rested, and the last group continued with the UUTs. At the end of 12 minutes, all students who took a break from the UUT returned to their original UUTs as well as two new ones. Interestingly, those students who were given the undemanding activity scored 41% better on the repeated UUTs. The three other groups showed no improvement at all in the repeated UTTs. These results would suggest that taking a break from a problem and engaging in a light activity might help you with your problem. In his biography of Einstein, Walter Isaacson wrote this: Music was no mere diversion. On the contrary, it helped him think. “Whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or faced a difficult challenge in his work,” wrote his son Hans Albert, “he would take refuge in music and that would solve all his difficulties.” The violin thus proved useful during the years he lived alone in Berlin, wrestling with general relativity. “He would often play his violin in his kitchen late at night, improvising melodies while he pondered complicated problems,” a friend recalled. “Then, suddenly, in the middle of playing, he would announce excitedly, ‘I’ve got it!’ As if by inspiration, the answer to the problem would have come to him in the midst of music.”10 Clearly Einstein was engaging in an undemanding activity that clearly helped him come to a way to move forward. Asael Sklar and her research group use the relatively recent experimental technique of continuous flash suppression (CFS) to test whether we can do arithmetic subcon- sciously.11 The technique works like this. Two distinct video feeds are sent to each of an experimental subject’s eyes. One video feed is a sequence of Mondrian patterns that change quickly from pattern to pattern. The other begins with a blank white screen. When you are faced with such input, your focus is drawn to the Mondrian side to the exclusion of the other side. At a random time after the experiment begins, the blank screen shows an arithmetic equation, something like “9 − 2 − 3 =”, for 2 seconds. The video feeds are then turned off and the subject is presented with an arithmetic equation, and it was either the same one he or she saw in the stimulus part of the experiment or a different one, say “8 − 3 − 1 =”. The Compatible regime consisted of those experimental subjects who got the same equation, and the Incompatible regime were those subjects who got a different equation. For each subject, the experimenters measured the time to give a correct answer. As it turns out, the average time to give a correct answer for the Compatible regime was significantly less than it was for the Incompatible regime. I have 10 Walter Isaacson, Einstein: His Life and Universe (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2007), 14. 11 Asael Sklar, Nir Levy, Ariel Goldstein, Roi Mandel, Anat Maril, and Ran Hassin, “Reading and Doing Arithmetic Non- consciously,” PNAS 109, no. 48 (2012). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 113 not discussed the complete experimental protocol here but the experimenters did a num- ber of other tests to make sure, as best they could, that there were no other explanations for this difference in average solution times. This is a striking result. No experimental subject admitted to being aware of the equation shown to him or her in the stimulus part of the experiment. Yet the average solution time for the Compatible group is significantly lower. This evidence is consistent with the explanation that the equation registered with a subject’s subconscious mind. Obviously, we can’t tell what sort of processing was done by the subconscious but, whatever it was, it enabled the subject to solve it more quickly when he or she saw it consciously. It was once thought that abstract symbolic processing required the conscious mind. This experiment suggests that that’s not true and that the subconscious mind is capable of abstract symbolic thought. 6.3 Dysrationalia Keith Stanovich coined the term dysrationalia to describe the tendency we have to violate the fundamentals of reasoning in certain situations.12 For example, consider this problem: Jack is looking at Anne, but Anne is looking at George. Jack is married; George is not. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person? Answer “yes,” “no,” or “can’t be determined.” Using System 1, most answer “can’t be determined.” However, let’s look at it with System 2 thinking. Suppose that Anne is married. In that case, Anne (married) is looking at George (unmarried) and the correct answer is “yes.” Now suppose Anne is unmarried. Now we have that Jack (married) is looking at Anne (unmarried) and, again, the correct answer is “yes.” For both of Anne’s marital possibilities, it’s always true that a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Therefore, the correct answer is “yes.” Here is another example: Suppose there are 50 people at a cocktail party. We are interested in the chance that two or more people have a birthday on the same calendar date. If one person is born on May 14, 1959, and another on May 14, 1964, then it’s true that there are at least two people with the same calendar date. Assume there are 365 days in a year. Is this chance (a) less than 15%, (b) somewhere between 15% and 85%, or (c) greater than 85%. Most people answer (a) with a few choosing (b). But the correct answer is (c). With 50 people in a room, the probability that at least two people have the same calendar birth- date is 97%. Hence, it’s almost a sure bet that you would find at least two people with 12 Keith Stanovich, “Dysrationalia: A New Specific Learning Disability,” Journal of Learning Disabilities 26, no. 8 (1993). 114 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation the same birthday. The point is why so many people misjudge this problem. There are some problems for which our intuitions (System 1) don’t work very well and this is one of them. Now let’s look at an interesting experiment by the cognitive psychologist Peter Wason.13 He gave experimental subjects the sequence 2, 4, 6 as an example of a rule he had in mind. He then gave subjects the chance to test any triplet they wanted before final- izing their guess at the rule. Most of them tested sequences consistent with the rule “con- secutive even numbers,” sequences like “12, 14, 16” and “6, 8, 10.” Of course, these sequences are poor tests if the rule is “consecutive integers separated by 2” (in which case 3, 5, 7 fits) or “increasing integers” (in which case 2, 5, 12 fits). Wason’s conclusion was that subjects came very quickly to the rule “consecutive even integers” and then tested a sequence of triplets to confirm this rule. This tendency, to look for evidence confirming a belief, is called the confirmation bias and many experimental studies since have rep- licated Wason’s results. The effect has been known for some time. Here is what Francis Bacon (1561–1626 CE) had to say: The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects and despises, or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects; in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate.14 Bacon understood the confirmation bias. The confirmation bias is a trap I have fallen into on more than one occasion. When I am trying to explain something, my System 1 kicks in and finds a provisional explanation. The trick is not to then get wedded to it but rather to look at it critically to make sure it will hold up. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky were the first to look at a whole series of these reasoning flaws and biases.15 Their early work provided the basis for a lot of follow-on research by a number of scholars. But this work must be put in perspective. These reason- ing flaws largely arise because we apply our System 1 intuitive thinking to an idea or a problem. I think that, over time, we’ve done some pretty amazing things when we let our System 2 process take care of business. For example, consider Copernicus (1473–1543 CE). In his time, the idea of the universe was Ptolemy’s geocentric model where the Earth 13 Peter Wason, “On the Failure to Eliminate Hypotheses in a Conceptual Task,” Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 12, no. 3 (1960). 14 Francis Bacon, “Novum Organum,” in The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill, ed. Edwin Burtt (New York: Random House, 1939), 36. 15 Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, “Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases,” Science 185, no. 4157 (1974). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 115 was stationary and all heavenly bodies moved. In explaining his desire to take a different approach, Copernicus wrote this: For a long time I reflected on the confusion in the astronomical traditions concerning the derivation of the motion of the spheres of the Universe. I began to be annoyed that the philosophers had discovered no sure scheme for the movements of the machinery of the world, created for our sake by the best and most systematic Artist of all. Therefore, I began to consider the mobility of the Earth and even though the idea seemed absurd, nevertheless I knew that others before me had been granted the freedom to imagine any circles whatsoever for explaining the heavenly phenomena.16 The key phrase is the leading “For a long time.” Copernicus did not come to his Heliocen- tric Universe right away. He had to think a lot about the problem. Eventually it didn’t seem reasonable to him that the “most systematic Artist of all” would design something as com- plicated as the models that had been put forward to explain planetary motion. Consequently he started to think about the Earth moving “even though the idea seemed absurd.” This was clearly System 2 thinking. The point is that, when we use our System 2 cognition, we’re pretty clever. We’ve figured out that the world is not flat, that we’re not at the center of the universe, and that we’re descended from a common ancestor with chimpanzees. Give us some time and we’ll figure it out! 6.4 What We Can Learn from Chimpanzee Cognition About 98% of our DNA is the same as a chimpanzee’s. Among all other species, they are our closest relatives, and gazing into a chimpanzee’s face, it’s easy to see we’re related. In this section, I’ll review what we know about chimpanzee cognition, and in so doing, we’ll develop a better understanding of our own. This is not meant to be a comprehensive review of chimpanzee cognition. Rather, I sim- ply want to mention those aspects of their cognition that are relevant to this analysis. Communication Chimpanzees communicate with a mixture of facial expression, gesture, and some vocaliza- tion. Since they are only able to make a small number of sounds, their communication is largely by gesture and facial expression. Their gesturing has been studied intensely for about sixty years and primatologists are discovering a significant repertoire of gestures (facial expressions, arm movements including beckoning and pointing, full body movements like 16 Owen Gingerich, “The Astronomy and Cosmology of Copernicus,” in Highlights of Astronomy Volume 3, ed. G Contopoulos, International Astronomical Union, (Dordrecht: Springer, 1974). 116 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation jumping up and down, sounds, etc.) with associated meanings. Summaries of this research can be found in papers by Catherine Hobaiter et al. and Richard Byrne et al.17 Like human language, some of these gestures have different meanings depending on the context. Just as the only way I can tell whether a person means “see” or “sea” is through con- text, the same principle applies to some chimpanzee gestures. Scientists look closely at what happens after the gesture. The chimpanzee delivering the signal usually keeps watching the recipient to make sure the signal is received. Sometimes the gesture is repeated if there is no reaction. Scientists also look at the nature of the response to make sure they are classifying the meaning of the signal properly. It’s worth noting that, with instruction, non-human primates appear to be capable of sym- bolic communication. For example, the bonobo Kanzi, studied by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, has a repertoire of about 400 words. He doesn’t speak these words but, instead, touches the appropriate series of lexigrams on a lexigram machine. A lexigram machine is effectively a computer which shows a large number of lexigram icons on a screen. When Kanzi touches one of these icons the underlying word is pronounced by the machine. With this machine, Kanzi is able to make statements, ask questions, and generally make himself understood. A good summary of Savage-Rumbaugh’s work can be found in Igor Henzel’s paper.18 Chimpanzees tend to stay away from direct eye-to-eye contact as it tends to be threaten- ing. As a warning signal, they will sometimes bare their canines. Interestingly, when humans use threatening language, we sometimes bare our canines as the threat is uttered. Non-human primates engage in an inordinate amount of grooming. This serves two pur- poses. The first is practical. With grooming, the groomer removes ticks and other bugs, dirt, and old skin and hence it makes for a healthier groomee. The second purpose is social. With grooming, there is a release of endorphins (neurotransmitters in the brain) and a feeling of pleasure for the groomee. Hence, non-primates have an incentive to both give and receive. In this way, grooming is also used to build social relationships. Coalition and alliance building are important within primate groups and grooming is a way to grease these relationships. Not surprisingly, grooming has been observed in primitive human societies. Robin Dunbar argues that human gossip/small talk serves essentially the same purpose as grooming in non- human primate societies.19 Emotion There is evidence that chimpanzees experience a range of emotions just as we do. I refer the interested reader to a YouTube video of the emotional reunion of a dying chimpanzee and one of her keepers.20 17 See Catherine Hobaiter and Richard Byrne, “The Meanings of Chimpanzee Gestures,” Current Biology 24, no. 14 (2014); and Richard Byrne, Erica Cartmil, Emilie Genty, Kirsty Graham, Catherine Hobaiter, and Joanne Tanner, “Great Ape Gestures: Intentional Communication with a Rich Set of Innate Signals,” Animal Cognition 20, no. 4 (2017). 18 Igor Hanzel, “Sue Savage-Rumbaugh’s Research into Ape Language—Science and Methodology,” Organon F 19, no. 2 (2012). 19 Robin Dunbar, Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language (London: Faber and Faber, 1996). 20 https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=LFXTCGeAV9s. Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 117 Cooperative Hunting Behavior Some chimpanzee troops hunt the red colobus monkey in groups. Christophe Boesch docu- ments that this hunting requires highly coordinated individual behavior.21 Individual chimpan- zees take one of three roles: driver, blocker, and ambusher. The basic strategy is for a driver and blockers to funnel a red colobus into an ambusher. The attack begins with a driver heading up a tree to get their prey moving. Blockers, who are also high up in adjacent trees, try to funnel them. The ambusher on the ground observes this funnel starting and the direction of a target colobus’s movement. He then runs ahead and selects a tree that the colobus is likely to get to, climbs it, and hides waiting for the colobus to arrive. If a colobus does arrive, the hunt is usually over quickly with either the ambusher or one of the trailing blockers doing the killing. If the prey gets to a non-ambusher tree, the chimpanzees make quick adjustments to their roles and carry on with the hunt. These hunts have been so successful that, at times, there has been con- cern for the survival of the red colobus population in various locales. The organization of the hunt constitutes evidence of the cognitive skills required for highly coordinated group behavior. Interestingly, many other species hunt cooperatively. One of the more interesting coop- erative behaviors is by orcas facing seals on small ice flows. Three to four of them will swim together at the ice flow and, in the process, cause a wave which knocks the seals off the ice flow and to their impending doom.22 Malini Suchak et al. developed an interesting experiment to determine whether chimpan- zees are capable of learning a particular cooperative behavior to get a reward.23 A group of 11 chimpanzees were free to choose partners to pull at an apparatus to get a reward. In one experimental condition, two apes were required to pull simultaneously to get the reward; in the other, three were required. The apes did this experiment over 94 one-hour sessions, 3 per week. They were given no instruction on how the apparatus worked so initially they had to learn how to do it. Once they learned, there was non-stop cooperation for the rest of the experiment. This experimental evidence sits in contrast to the usual view of chimpanzees as more competitive than cooperative. One of the reasons the authors give for their result is that the apes were free to choose partners and this encouraged more cooperative behavior. Tool Use Chimpanzees also do some interesting things with tools.24 They use rocks to crack open nuts, sticks to fish termite mounds, and fashion spears to hunt bush babies, a small, tree-dwelling 21 Christophe Boesch, “Joint Cooperative Hunting Among Wild Chimpanzees: Taking Natural Observations Seriously,” Behavior and Brain Sciences 28, no. 5 (2005). An excellent National Geographic video of such a hunt can be found at https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=A1WBs74W4ik. 22 Videos of these hunts can be seen here: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=g1VEwsI4SlY. 23 Malini Suchak, Timothy Eppley, Matthew Campbell, Rebecca Feldman, Luke Quarles, and Frans de Waal, “How Chim- panzees Cooperate in a Competitive World,” PNAS 113, no. 36 (2016). 24 Christophe Boesch and Helwige Boesch, “Hunting Behavior of Wild Chimpanzees in the Tai National Park,” American Journal of Physical Anthropology 78, no. 4 (1989). 118 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation primate. They also make sticks to withdraw marrow out of carcass bones. All of these are evidence of learned cultural behavior. Working Memory Chimpanzees have remarkable working memories. Sana Inoue and Tetsuro Matsuzawa sat chimpanzees in front of a computer screen with the digits 1–9 in random locations on the screen.25 Each chimp would study the screen for as long he needed and would then hit the number 1. When he did this, a blank square region was substituted for each of the other num- bers. The chimpanzee’s task was to touch the shaded regions in order from 2 to 9. If he was successful, his reward was a peanut. In the iterations of this experiment I’ve seen on You- Tube, the chimpanzee studied the screen for perhaps a second and then quickly hit one and the rest of the integers in order.26 It was amazing to watch. I’d have difficulty with this task. As it turns out, humans are capable of outperforming chimpanzees on it.27 This experiment certainly illustrates that chimpanzees possess the prerequisites for sym- bolic processing because they are able to recognize the numbers 1–9 in order. More impor- tantly, they’re demonstrating a significant working memory which, in humans, is highly correlated with general intelligence. Exclusionary Reasoning Consider the following experiment.28 A chimpanzee is shown two cups where it knows that a food reward is in one of the cups. The experimenter will select one of the cups at random and shake it. If the selected cup is the baited cup, the food reward will be heard hitting the sides of the cup; if the selected cup is empty, there will be no sound. Once the cup is shaken, the experimenter will return the cup to sit alongside the other and then allow the chimpanzee to choose one of the cups. In all trials (12 chimpanzees and 24 trials for each chimpanzee), the chimpanzee was able to identify the cup with the food reward. Abstract Reasoning One way to look at chimpanzee abstract reasoning is with Match-to-Sample problems. They work like this. First, consider a Simple Match-to-Sample problem. I will show you a sample, say the symbol “A” and then two objects, say the symbols “A” and “B.” The Simple Match-to-Sample task requires you to pick which object matches the sample. In this case, you would choose “A.” Now consider a Relational Match-to-Sample problem. I will show you a sample, say the sym- bol “AA” and then two objects, say the symbols “BB” and “CD.” The Relational Match-to-Sample 25 Sana Inoue and Tetsuro Matsuzawa, “Working Memory of Numerals in Chimpanzees,” Current Biology 17, no. 23 (2007). 26 You can see it here: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A&t=82s. 27 Peter Cook and Margaret Wilson, “Do Young Chimpanzees Have Extraordinary Working Memory?,” Psychomonic Bulletin & Review 17, no. 4 (2010). 28 Josep Call, “Inferences About the Location of Food in the Great Apes (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo pygmaeus),” Journal of Comparative Psychology 118, no. 2 (2004). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 119 task requires you to pick the object which most closely matches the sample. In this case, you would choose “BB” because you’ve assessed that “BB” is closer to “AA” than “CD.” The Rela- tional Match-to-Sample is more difficult because you have to recognize a relation between the two symbols in the sample. Here you’ve recognized the characteristic of equality. Here is another example. Suppose I give you the sample “AB” and the objects “CC” and “DE.” In this case, you would choose “DE” because, like the sample “AB,” the two symbols making up the object are dissimilar. To be able to do Relational Match-to-Sample problems, you must think abstractly. In the two cases above, you must be able to understand and assess the abstract notions of “sameness” and “difference.” Chimpanzees have an easy time with Simple Match-to-Sample experiments but are gener- ally not able to do Relational Match-to-Sample problems. But as reported by David Oden et al., there is an exception, the chimpanzee Sarah.29 Sarah was first taught to associate a particular symbol with two objects the same and another symbol for two objects that were different. Let us suppose the symbols were respectively “same” and “different.” Once the experimenters were comfortable with Sarah understanding the symbols “same” and “different,” they gave her a series of Relational Match-to-Sample problems and she was able to do them! This is quite inter- esting. When Sarah understood the abstract symbols for “same” and “different,” she was able to apply them to the Relational Match-to-Sample problems. As discussed by Dedre Gentner and Mary Jo Ratterman, a child is capable of simple object matches but is only capable of relational matches once a sufficiently high educational threshold has been reached.30 There is an important point to be made here about human cognition. It is one thing to be able to fashion a physical object like a stone tool. As I’ve already suggested, our ancient ancestors made the connection between the sharp edge they could put on a piece of stone and the ease with which they could strip meat off the bones of a carcass. It’s quite another to be able to develop our symbolic toolkit, a toolkit that helps us reason in a very sophisti- cated way. It’s clear that chimpanzee imaginations allow them to make physical tools (like fashioning a stick into a tool to extract termites from a mound). However, they are not capa- ble of the sort of abstract reasoning we do to mine the A Class. Hence, while chimps are capable of C Class ideation (in a limited way), A Class ideation appears to be beyond them. Theory of Mind Primatologists have studied chimpanzee Theory of Mind for some time, dating to the origi- nal work of David Premack and Guy Woodruff.31 A good review can be found in a paper 29 David Oden, Roger Thompson, and David Premack, “Can an Ape Reason Analogically? Comprehension and Produc- tion of Analogical Problems by Sarah, a Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes),” in Dedre Gentner, Keith Holyoak, and Boicho Kokinov (eds.), The Analogical Mind: Perspectives from Cognitive Science (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001). 30 Dedre Gentner and Mary Jo Ratterman, “Language and the Career of Similarity,” Technical Report 533, The Center for the Study of Reading, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois. 31 David Premack and Guy Woodruff, “Does the Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind?,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1, no. 4 (1978). 120 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation by Josep Call and Michael Tomasello32 who conclude that chimpanzees exhibit a Theory of Mind, albeit one that is not capable of passing the false belief test. No animal has ever passed the false belief test. The Herrmann et al. Study To assess the relative importance of our general intelligence (GI) and social intelligence (SI), Esther Herrmann and her colleagues looked at the performances of 30-month-old children and chimpanzees on a battery of tests.33 Rather than describe all the GI tests, I’ll describe two of them to give readers an appre- ciation for the particular kind of intelligence required by each class of tests. RotationTest. Threecupswereplacedinarowonarotatableplatforminfrontofthesubject. The subject watched as the experimenter then placed a reward under one of the cups. Then the tray was rotated in one of three ways: 1. 180 degrees / Middle: The reward was placed under the middle cup and then the platform was rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise 180 degrees. This had no effect on the location of the reward. It remained in the middle. 2. 360 degrees / Left or Right: The reward was placed either under the left-edge cup or the right-edge cup and then the platform was rotated 360 degrees. Again, this had no effect on the location of the reward. 3. 180 degrees / Left or Right: The reward was placed either under the left-edge cup or the right-edge cup and then the platform was rotated 180 degrees. This changed the location of the reward. If it started under the left-edge cup, its post-rotation position was the right-edge cup; and if it started under the right-edge cup, its post-rotation position was the left-edge cup. At this point, the subject gets to choose a cup and if the baited cup is chosen first, the response is marked correct. Addition Test. Three plates are put in front of the subject in a line and then an occluder is put up so the subject could not see how the plates were being baited. Once the plates were baited [an integral number of peanuts (or raisins) were placed on the plates], they were covered with lids and then the occluder was removed. Now the subject could see all three covered plates. At this point, the experimenter removed the lids of the plates on the sides (the left-edge and right-edge plates) so that the subject could see their contents. The subject was given 5 seconds to view these contents and then the experimenter put the lids back on. At this point, the experi- menter removed the lid of the middle plate so the subject could see its contents. Again, the subject was given 5 seconds to assess the contents of the plate. Then the experimenter took the 32 Josep Call and Michael Tomasello, “Does the Chimpanzee Have a Theory of Mind? 30 Years Later,” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 12, no. 5 (2008). 33 Esther Herrmann, Josep Call, Maria Hernàndez-Lloreda, Brian Hare, and Michael Tomasello, “Humans Have Evolved Specialized Skills of Social Cognition: the Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis,” Science 317, no. 5843 (2007). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 121 entire contents of the middle plate and put all of them under either the left-edge or right-edge plate in such a way that the subject could not see the original contents of the left-edge and right-edge plates. Then the middle plate was taken away and the subject could choose either the left-edge or right-edge plate. If the plate with the highest number of peanuts was selected, a correct score was marked. Here is an example. Suppose the left-edge plate had 2 peanuts, the middle, 2 peanuts, and the right-edge, 1 peanut. Subsequently, suppose the middle peanuts were transferred to the left-edge plate. The left-edge plate now has 4 peanuts, and the right- edge plate contains 1. The subject should choose the left-edge plate. Now to the SI tests. Again, I’ll describe only two of them. Paper Tube Test. The experimenter first showed the subject a transparent tube with a vis- ible reward inside with paper covering both ends. The experimenter then took her finger and broke through the paper on one of the ends. Once through, she twisted her finger to make more of an opening. Then she tipped the tube up and let the reward fall out. The subject was then given an identical tube. If the subject was able to repeat the steps the experimenter used, a correct response was recorded. Communication/Comprehension. The experiment placed two cups in front of the subject. An occluder is put up and then one of the cups is baited. Then the occluder is removed. At this point, the experimenter gives one of three different cues. For the Look cue, the experiment alternated her gaze between the subject and the baited cup three times while calling out the subject’s name. Then she fixed her gaze on the baited cup until the subject chose a cup. For the Point cue, the experimenter continuously pointed at the baited cup while changing her gaze from the subject to the cup three times again calling out the subject’s name. After the three gaze repetitions, she stopped pointing and just continued to gaze at the baited cup until the subject chose a cup. If the subject chose the baited cup, a correct response was marked. For the Marker cue, the experi- menter held a picture of the reward in her hand. She then alternated her gaze between the picture and the subject three times while calling out the subject’s name each time. Then she placed the picture on the baited cup. If the subject chose the baited cup, a correct response was marked. The GI tests did not require any social interaction whereas the SI tests clearly did. I have examined all of the tests in each class (GI and SI) and I judge them to be excellent instru- ments for measuring their respective intelligence. So, what did Herrmann et al. find? Statistically, there was no difference between the chimpanzees and children on GI scores. But on their battery of SI tests, the performance of the children was superior to the chimpanzee performance. More particularly, it was superior on the tests of social learning. This is powerful evidence supporting the position that our SI is important. It’s not that we’re just on average smarter than chimpanzees. It also derives from our special set of social cognition skills. Summary The evidence of this section suggests that chimpanzees are very intelligent. But, relative to us, they have two important limitations. First, they have not shown an ability to reason abstractly 122 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation (they can’t do relative Match-to-Sample problems). Second, their social intelligence is not as refined as ours and particularly in social learning which is the hallmark of cumulative culture. 6.5 Seeing What’s Hard to See What we’re really good at is seeing patterns, analogy, and metaphor. In this section I’ll have a look at these skills. Raven’s Progressive Matrices, usually found on certain kinds of intelligence tests, work as follows. In the diagram below there are 8 dot-stick figures: 3 in the first row, 3 in the sec- ond, and 2 in the third: The third dot-stick figure in each of the first two rows is derived from a rule that operates on the first two dot-stick figures in each row. You first have to determine what the rule is and then apply it to the first two dot-stick figures in the third row to determine which of the 8 dot-stick figures below should go in the box at the bottom right above: This is a difficult problem that I lifted from a paper by Tom Verguts and Paul De Boeck.34 It took me the better part of an hour to get the solution. 34 Tom Verguts and Paul De Boeck, “The Induction of Solution Rules in Raven’s Progressive Matrices Test,” European Journal of Cognitive Psychology 14, no. 4 (2002). Flantinori. https://creativecommons. org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed. en Flantinori. https://creativecommons. org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed. en Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 123 How do you go about doing them? There are probably some good techniques to get you going but I was not aware of them, so I basically had to start from scratch in the first row. Since there is no obvious rule, we’re into a System 2 search. We’ll hypothesize a rule (once we see one) and then check to see that it works. If it doesn’t, we’ll discard it and search for another. We might start by observing that there is a dot in the center of every dot-stick figure including the 8 possible solutions. So, a dot is a part of the rule. What else can we try? Let’s first classify the line types. Let’s partition them into horizon- tal lines, vertical lines, and 45-degree lines. Since we have to start somewhere, let’s look at the horizontal lines in the first row. For row 1, there is a single horizontal line in each of the first two dot-stick diagrams but there is no horizontal line in the third dot-stick diagram. That is consistent with this rule: if a horizontal line is common to the first two dot-stick diagrams, do not include it in the third dot-stick diagram. Let’s see if that works for the second line. It does work! Hence, this appears to be a good rule. Unfortunately, there are no horizontal lines in the third row, so it’s not much use to us. Let’s now look at vertical lines. There appear to be two types, ones heading south and ones pointing to the north (determined from the reference point of the dot). So, let’s refer to south vertical lines and north vertical lines. In the first row, the first dot-stick diagram has a south vertical line, the second has a north vertical line, and the third has both a north and south vertical line. We might hypothesize this rule: if a dot-stick diagram has either a north or south vertical line, put that line in the third dot-stick diagram. Let’s check to see if that rule works for line 2 . . . Yes, it appears to work in line 2. Now we have a rule we can apply in the third line because its dot-stick figures have vertical lines. You would keep going in this fashion working up good rules. I would ask the reader to try to get the complete set of rules. You can check the footnote at the end of this sentence to see what the correct answer is once you arrive at your solution.35 Here is another problem: 35 The correct answer is 2. Flantinori. https://creativecommons. org/ publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed. en 124 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation The possible answers are in the last row and labelled A, B, C, and D. Take a few minutes and try to solve it. Once you’ve finished read on. When I first looked at this problem, I focussed on the position of the dots, trying to see how they changed from figure to figure. I wasn’t making any headway when I suddenly thought to count the dots in the figures to see if any rule presented itself. If you do this, you get 563 674 78 and from this, it’s clear that the unknown figure must have 5 dots and, happily, only one solu- tion has 5 dots: C. The point of this example is that I was focussed on the wrong feature. I was looking at the position of the dots when I should have been looking at the number of dots. These Raven’s Progressive Matrix problems illustrate a number of important points. First, coming up with rules requires some experimentation. You look at the input pictures and, with your imagination, generate a rule. This rule is provisional until you can verify that it works in both lines 1 and 2. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, you look for another rule. Second, the lion’s share of your thought is System 2 thinking. But there is also an element of System 1 thinking to come up with possible rules. For example, in the second example, deciding to switch to just counting the dots seemed to come from nowhere. There was cer- tainly no antecedent condition leading to it other than the frustration I was feeling looking at dot positions and how they changed. My sudden switch to counting the dots is an example of an aha or eureka moment. The poster boy for this phenomenon is Archimedes who, while bathing, suddenly discovered the way to measure the volume of a complex shape. Then there is Newton who supposedly gets to gravity after he is beaned by a falling apple. The great mathematician Henri Poincare writes of “sudden illumination” and described it this way: Just at this time, I left Caen, where I was living, to go on a geologic excursion under the auspices of the School of Mines. The incidents of the travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go some place or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidian geometry. I did not verify the idea; I should not have had time, as, upon taking my seat in the omnibus, I went on with a conversation already commenced, but I felt a perfect certainty. On my return to Caen, for conscience’ sake, I verified the result at my leisure.36 36 Henri Poincare, Science and Method (New York: Walter Scott Publishing, 1914), 53. Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 125 If you look at the history of great ideas, it seems that all thinkers come to a point where a small insight, an aha moment, shows them the way forward. Let’s first consider Charles Darwin’s ideas about evolution. Darwin studied botany and natural history his whole life. He spent five of those years on a sea voyage collecting new data. He filled many notebooks with observations, musings, and ideas. Eventually, his imagination brought him to evolution by natu- ral selection. We’ll never know exactly what went on in Darwin’s head. By his admission, he was influenced by the thinking of the economist Thomas Malthus on population. Malthus was aware of the role of famine and disease in limiting population growth. In “An Essay on the Principle of Population” (1798), he put forward the idea that a population facing scarce resources (say through famine) would compete for those resources resulting in the stronger individuals surviving. Darwin admitted that this idea got him thinking about a similar competi- tion in nature, one where only the fittest animals and plants would survive to reproduce. This is an example of analogical thinking where you apply the key attributes driving one situation to the key attributes of another. Analogy is akin to pattern recognition. Another example of analogical “aha” thinking comes from the Wright brothers and their decision to warp the wings of their glider to affect a change in direction. We know that they looked at James Pettigrew’s book on animal locomotion.37 In Wilbur’s notebook dated September-October 1900, he made the following observation about a gliding pigeon: Moreover, the oscillations of lateral balance are so rapid that gravity alone could not possibly produce them. The bird certainly twists its wing tips so that the wind strikes one wing on top and the other on its lower side, thus by force changing the bird’s lateral position.38 The bird’s movement of its wingtips in the opposite directions (one up, the other down) led to wing warping and modern ailerons. This is analogical thinking. In summary, coming up with ideas is sometimes a case of discovering patterns and regu- larities that are hidden from our direct sight. As I have argued above, it is our imagination with our System 2 machinery engaged which leads to new ideas. How do our imaginations come up with these ideas? As I intimated at the beginning of this chapter, we just don’t know. But it’s certainly a happy state of affairs that we can. 6.6 Discovery versus Creation The mathematician Jacques Hadamard, (1865–1963 CE), discussing the ideas of the French psychologist Etienne Souriau, (1892–1979 CE), suggested that there is a key difference between ideas in the Arts and those in the Sciences.39 He argued that artists have more freedom because 37 James Pettigrew, Animal Locomotion or Walking, Swimming, and Flying With a Dissertation on Aëronautics (New York: D Appleton and Co., 1874). 38 Marvin McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1953), 35. 39 Jacques Hadamard, The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1948), xii. 126 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation scientists are only able to discover what nature puts before them whereas artists are free to go where their creative inspiration takes them. Artists create and scientists discover. On this point, E. O. Wilson remarked The realm of science is everything possible in the universe; the realm of the humanities is everything conceivable to the human mind.40 Humour is a good example of creativity. American journalist Molly Ivins once commented on the work of a local congressman, suggesting that “if his I. Q. slips any lower, we’ll have to water him twice a day.” That’s a fine metaphor (analogy). But it wasn’t discovered. It was created. 6.7 Expertise and Ideas Einstein wasn’t a dog-catcher. Picasso didn’t work as a carpenter. And Newton, despite his mother’s plans for him, was not a farmer. All three were drawn to their craft, crafts which required a considerable investment in knowledge and skill. Let’s now consider how expertise impacts the imagination. Chess Expertise Chess is played with the mind. The interesting question is what cognitive skill separates great chess players from merely good ones. Adriaan de Groot was the first to look at this.41 He studied three classes of player: Grandmasters and Masters; Experts; and Amateurs. His general finding was that the search strategies used by the classes—as measured by number of moves examined, depth of search, and speed of search—were indistinguishable. The only difference he could observe was that Grandmasters and Masters players just made better moves than the other two classes. In another experiment, he assessed the recall of these classes in the following way. He showed a player an actual chess position (taken from an actual Grandmaster match). These positions averaged 25 pieces on the board. After showing the player a position for a duration which varied between 2 and 10 seconds, he asked the player to recreate the position from memory. The following table gives the percentages of pieces that each of three classes were able to recall correctly: Class Grandmaster/Master Experts Amateurs Recall Percentage 93% 72% 50% 40 E. O. Wilson, The Origins of Creativity (New York: Liveright Publishing Corporation, 2017), 4. 41 Adriaan de Groot, Thought and Choice in Chess (The Hague: Mouton and Company, 1965). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 127 These results are not too surprising. Good players have a better recollection of actual positions. Subsequently, Herbert Simon and William Chase repeated de Groot’s experiment except that subjects were asked to recall randomly generated positions rather than actual match positions.42 This made quite a difference. The recall of all classes was about the same and very poor. The subjects were only able to place about 15% of the pieces correctly. This research suggests that chess experts have a very specialized memory. This accords with some research on the brains of London cabbies. The hippocampus is that region of our brain responsible for spatial memory and navigation. Eleanor Maguire and her colleagues compared the structure of the hippocampi of London cabbies to those of a control group using structural MRI.43 Taxi-drivers in London take about two years of training to learn where literally thousands of places are and how to navigate among them. The experimenters found significant differences in the hippocampi of the taxi-drivers and those of the control group. Those of the taxi-drivers were significantly larger with a different structure (the part of the hippocampus thought to be associated with storing spatial knowledge was larger for the taxi-drivers). Moreover, the variation in hippocampus size was correlated positively with driver experience. This is interesting because it suggests that the brain adapts to the cogni- tive activity it’s engaged in. In other words, an individual’s active engagement with the world shapes his or her mind. Effectively, experience in the world rewires the brain’s circuitry. This is referred to as brain plasticity, and it would appear that a chess expert’s brain is altered by the focus on chess required to get to expert levels. The current world number one, Magnus Carlson, has a phenomenal memory. He can play 10 opponents blind-folded. For each move with each opponent, he is told the opponent’s most recent move, and based on his memory of the position in that game and his opponent’s move, he makes his choice. In an interview with Bob Simon of 60 Minutes, Carlson says that he sees the correct move almost immediately. He does not engage in any sort of conscious evaluation of a number of good moves. When Simon then asked why he took so long to make a move, Carlson explained that the rest of the time was spent making sure the move he was considering didn’t have any glaring weaknesses. This would suggest that Carlson uses Sys- tem 1 thinking to arrive at a reasonable move and then attempts to verify that this move is a good one with System 2 thought. Kahneman and Klein on Expertise Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein have done some important work on the nature of intui- tive expertise.44 Klein has studied organizational decision-makers who must make difficult decisions under time constraints. An example is a military commander engaged in a difficult 42 Herbert Simon and William Chase, “Skill in Chess,” American Scientist 61, no. 4 (1972). 43 Eleanor Maguire, David Gadian, Ingrid Johnsrude, Catriona Good, John Ashburner, Richard Frackowiak, and Christopher Frith, “Navigation-related Structural Change in the Hippocampi of Taxi Drivers,” PNAS 97, no. 8 (2000). 44 Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein, “Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree,” American Psychologist 64, no. 6 (2009). 128 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation operation. The commander is relying on his expertise and, at times, System 1 thinking to make decisions. Another example is a chess Grandmaster deciding on his or her next move. Klein calls these decisions recognition-primed decisions (RPDs). The idea is that the expert decision-maker, in certain situations, can rely on his or her experience and cues from the situation to arrive at a decision. Kahneman is interested in decision-making in relatively similar situations where an expert can be assisted with some form of machine intelligence to enhance decision-making. One area of joint interest is why RPDs worked well in some professions (firefighting) but not in others (parole officers). They suggest that the decision-making environment must have two important characteristics. First, the environment must offer valid cues as to the nature of the situation, and second, decision-makers must have the opportunity to learn the relevant cues. Regarding cues, the decision-maker needs to be able to recognize them and then act on them. There is no need for he or she to be able to explain the nature of the cues and how they work. For example, Magnus Carlson might have difficulty putting into words his detailed thought to arrive at a move. Based on his performance, we know that he’s able to deal quite well with the cues he gets. Children may not be able to explain how a horse is different from a cow, but they definitely know which is which when they see them. Conversely, there is good evidence that the average stockbroker has difficulty identifying good stock picks regularly. The stockbroker’s environment does not provide him reliable regular cues with which to make good picks. Learning is almost always the result of experience in the profession. Generally, doctors are better at diagnosis as they become more experienced. The best lawyers often have grey hair. Good military commanders also have grey hair. On the other hand, good chess players can gain the experience they need with solitary study at a relatively young age. The American phenom Bobby Fischer (1943–2008 CE) spent about 10 times more time studying than play- ing. In fact, Fischer ran out of English language material to study so he learned Russian in order to study their chess literature. Music and Perfect Pitch In a recent book, Anders Ericsson begins with the example of people who have a musical talent called “perfect pitch.”45 An individual with perfect pitch can identify a note when he or she hears it. If a C is played, the individual can identify C; if a B flat is played, the individual can identify B flat, and so on. The frequency of this skill in the general population is thought to be 1 in 10,000. As you might expect, it is more frequent among composers and musicians. For instance, Mozart, Beethoven, and Sinatra are thought to have had it. 45 Anders Ericsson, Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise (London: Bodley-Head, 2016). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 129 For some time, the conventional wisdom was that perfect pitch was a skill that people were born with. An interesting experiment changed that. A Japanese psychologist, Ayako Sakakibara, recruited 24 children between the ages of 2 and 6 and put them through a rigor- ous training program.46 Each child worked 4–5 sessions a day, with each session a couple of minutes. The task was to try to learn to identify 14 chords. The time for the children to learn these chords varied between 12 and 18 months. Overall, 22 of the 24 children who began the study completed it with 2 having to leave the experiment because they had moved away. Once training was finished, the children were tested for perfect pitch. All 22 children who completed the training were perfect pitch. This experiment strongly suggests that perfect pitch can be learned. This is an interesting result. Given that not many possess this skill naturally, I wouldn’t have bet that Sakakibara would have been successful. It demonstrates that, with enough prac- tice and dedication, humans can learn to “see” heavily disguised environmental cues. 6.8 The Takeaway: Memory Load Is Crucial All experts in a particular discipline, craft, or profession have loaded their long-term memo- ries with the knowledge, skills, and analysis techniques they require. I term this acquisition of knowledge the Memory Load (ML). The mise en scène of a thinker is as an expert drawing on his or her Memory Load to come up with ideas for moving forward. Let’s look at the ML in more detail. If we look at great thinkers, their experiences are all pretty much the same. Each has made a substantial investment in internalizing the knowledge and methods of his or her expertise. Moreover, this process usually occurs over a significant period of time and is fuelled by a single-minded intellectual curiosity that sometimes dominates his or her life. What does it mean to internalize knowledge and methods? By knowledge, I mean that your memory contains a large number of facts in your area of expertise. A physicist will have a good working knowledge of calculus. A good lawyer will know the law in his or her area of practice. A neurologist trains for years to develop an intimate understanding of neurological disorders. By method, I mean that a thinker is knowledgeable about techniques to create new ideas in his or her area of expertise. An historian is taught how to find and interpret original written sources to arrive at new interpretations of significant historical events. An accoun- tant is taught how to apply accounting principles so that he or she can arrive at reasonable assessments of a firm’s or individual’s financial position. Chemists know how to design experiments and function in a laboratory. Applied mathematicians know how to transform 46 Ayako Sakakibara, “A Longitudinal Study of the Process of Acquiring Absolute Pitch: A Practical Report of Training With the ‘Chord Identification Method,’” Psychology of Music 42, no. 1 (2014). 130 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation a real-world problem into a mathematical structure in cases where such a structure might be useful. The key word, though, is the internalization of knowledge and method and this is best understood in what it is not. In my view, the next big idea in an area of expertise is not likely to come from a Google search. Yes, machines in aid of memory and recall are important. But in the production of ideas, there is no machine that is a substitute for a mind able to examine seemingly different objects internally. Machines did not help Newton, Darwin, or Einstein. What these thinkers possessed was an intimate, internalized knowledge of method and the phenomena they were studying. This is not to say that external, searchable knowledge databases like Google are unim- portant, because they are. But, when an individual is trying to determine a way forward, an internalized knowledge and contemplation of that knowledge are key. To me, the essence of internalization is seen in an expert chess player. The evidence suggests that, over long years of study and play, a player effectively rewires his or her head. This rewiring leads to good move selections, the hallmark of an expert chess player. 6.9 The Diaconatic If we observed a thinker in the act of ideation and recorded what she was doing over time, we would see her alternating between two activities. One would be a planning effort where she’s at rest thinking about the problem and what to do next; the other would be an action activity where she engages with the external environment, usually with her hands, to make the adjustment called for by her thinking over the planning effort. For example, a novel- ist might alternate between thinking about what to write and writing what that thinking suggested. In this section, I’ll suggest a model of the ideation process—the diaconatic—which follows a sequence of these alternating planning and action activities. Before I do that, let’s consider the processes of several thinkers. Orville and Wilbur Wright We have already considered the Wrights. Their four-year process of coming to understand the principles of powered flight was surely a sequence of planning/action activities. Take, for example, Orville’s insight about moving the rudder rather than having it fixed. He thought about it one night, came to the idea, and then he and Wilbur tried it. Coming up with the idea is the idea stage and actually trying it is the action stage. Note that we could further break down the action stage into a sequence of planning/action steps to install a moveable rudder. Over the four years, the Wright brothers would have executed thousands of iterations of this cycle of plan/action steps. Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 131 Computer Coding Writing computer code is definitely a diaconatic process. It was my practice to write a short snippet of code and then compile it to see if it worked. I would continue with this process until I had the complete code written. Music Composition Gord Sinclair. Gord Sinclair is the bassist for The Tragically Hip, one of Canada’s finest rock bands. I asked him to describe how he comes up with ideas for songs. This was his response: I almost always compose on guitar. I don’t ever have a set agenda—I have never been able to punch a clock, go down to my studio and start writing. The first inspiration is the most elusive and satisfying part, which you can’t predict or control. Some of my best stuff has come during baseball or golf on TV. I will sit and watch with guitar in hand. I’m not really paying any attention to either, just noodling away and without fail the heavens open and new ideas fall out. My writing always starts with an instrumental riff or chord progression. There is something in the distraction (sports on TV) that frees up the creativity. Once I get the germ of an idea, I develop it into a song with more structure and then Gord [Gord Downie, the deceased frontman and lyricist of the Hip] would fill in the words from there to suit his taste.47 This is an experimental approach. A song’s chord progression is built over a number of tri- als. These trials are informed by Sinclair’s significant background in music. He grew up in a musical family, studied conservatory piano, and also plays the bagpipes. Mozart. Mozart (1756–1791 CE) did a lot in his short life. He left us with some of the most beautiful music the human race has managed to produce. His early biographers left the impression that he was a savant, basically composing in his head and then writing it down. The musicologist Ulrich Konrad recounts this romantic anecdote: . . . one thinks, for example, of the story that Mozart wrote out the overture to Don Giovanni on the eve of the premiere in the company of friends and in a state of semi-inebriation, having first played to a handful of acquaintances three different versions of the piece and asked them to choose which one they liked best.48 And there is the so-called Rochlitz Letter, purportedly from Mozart: All this fires my soul, and provided I am not disturbed, my subject enlarges itself, becomes methodized and defined, and the whole, though it be long, stands 47 Personal communication, received Nov 8, 2017. 48 Ulrich Konrad, “Mozart’s Sketches,” Early Music 20, no. 1 (1992). 132 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation almost finished and complete in my mind, so that I can survey it, like a fine picture or a beautiful statue, at a glance. Nor do I hear in my imagination the parts successively, but I hear them, as it were, all at once . . . When I proceed to write down my ideas, I take out of the bag of my memory, if I may use that phrase, what has previously been collected into it, in the way I have mentioned. For this reason, the committing to paper is done quickly enough, for everything is, as I said before, already finished; and it rarely differs on paper from what it was in my imagination.49 Are we to believe that Mozart worked through Eine Kleine Nachtmusik in his head sitting in a chair or lying in bed? The evidence from his private papers suggests otherwise. His basic approach was “to sketch” by composing little snippets daily. When he had enough of these, he would meld selected snippets together for a larger piece. Upon his death, there were a large number of snippets associated with unfinished work. This evidence alone would suggest that his com- position was not a matter of transcribing a complete piece from his head to paper. In addition, he apparently had trouble putting together string quartet compositions. With other work, he would first write the melody (say first violin), then the bass lines before add- ing the rest of the orchestration. But for string quartet pieces, he wrote all parts bar by bar. In the dedication of his string quartets for Hayden, he remarked that they were “the fruit of a long and labourius effort.”50 It sure doesn’t sound like these flowed easily from his mind to the page. I think it’s safe to say that Mozart’s process was trial and error, a recurring search for the next note. This is not to suggest that he did not have other-worldly skills as implied by play- wright Peter Shaffer who has Mozart’s rival Antonio Salieri say this in the movie Amadeus: “It seemed to me that I was hearing the very voice of God.” Even with such skills, it would have been impossible to do what Mozart did without quill, ink, paper, and a harpsichord. The Beatles and Sgt Pepper. In late 1966, the Beatles had made the decision not to tour and went into the studio to make an album different than what they had done. They had been influenced by the sounds the Beach Boys had produced on their album Pet Sounds. In the words of Sir George Martin (1926–2016 CE): When I first started in the music business, the ultimate aim for everybody was to try and recreate, on record, a live performance as accurately as possible. But then, we realized that we could do something other than that . . . So, without being too pompous, we decided to go into another kind of art form, where we are devising 49 Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, 1815, vol. 17, pp. 561–566. 50 Marius Flothuis, “A Close Reading of the Autograph of Mozart’s Ten Late Quartets,” in The String Quartets of Haydn, Mozard, and Beethoven: Studies of the Autograph Manuscripts, ed. Christoph Wolff (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980). Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 133 something that couldn’t be done any other way. We were putting something down on tape that could only be done on tape.51 Today, the individual sounds you hear in a piece of music are generally recorded digitally, each on a separate track. These tracks can be manipulated in any number of ways and then mixed to produce a final piece. An example is Eric Whitacre’s Sleep 2.0, a crowd-sourced mix of over 2000 voices, each submitted via YouTube. Whitacre selected 2052 videos to produce the final version.52 At the time Sgt. Pepper was made, this digital technology was not available. What they had was a 4-track analog tape recorder. With it, you could do things like record guitar, bass, and drums individually on Tracks 1, 2, and 3, and then mix or “bounce” them to Track 4. Then you could record voice on Track 1 with the instrumental mix you had previously done playing on Track 3. Then these two could be bounced to Track 4. If you wished to include another voice for harmony purposes, you could have it recorded on Track 1 with the instru- mentals and lead voice mix playing on Track 3. You could continue mixing in this fashion until you got to the finished song. This is what the Beatles, George Martin, and their Chief Sound Engineer, Geoff Emerick, did to make Sgt. Pepper. They basically reinvented the way music was recorded. The whole exercise took 700 hours of recording time, something unheard of at the time. Sgt Pepper was a large experiment that produced what the music industry has since considered to be a new art-form. Synthesis George Gershwin (1898–1937 CE) is said to have thought through most of Rhapsody in Blue on a train going from New York to Boston. That’s not the way most music is composed. The large preponderance of it is built snippet by snippet with painstaking experimentation, instrument at hand. Picasso and Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon Completed in 1907, Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon is a painting of five women of the night drawn from Picasso’s experience in the brothels of Avignon Street in Barcelona. It was painted in a precursor of the cubist style for which Picasso is famous. It’s not a replica of reality but rather Picasso’s interpretation using a new style. We know that Picasso worked for the better part of nine months preparing to do the piece. In the process he filled 16 sketchbooks with drawings, sketches, and studies. These were all aimed at deciding the composition and characters of the piece among other things. This is a diaconatic exercise. 51 Kenneth Womack, Sound Pictures: The Life of the Beatles Producer George Martin (Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2018). 52 https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=6WhWDCw3Mng. 134 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation The Diaconatic in More Detail There has been a significant effort over the last several decades to understand how the brain works. But to this point, we really haven’t figured out much about how it gives rise to our thoughts in a way that would benefit this inquiry. What is needed is a simple descriptive model. As described in the previous section, ideation seems to follow an experimental search. It requires us to do a series of iterations where, at each iteration, we decide what to do next and then execute that decision. This idea/action sequence recurs until the thinker gets to a finished idea. More formally, I propose that ideation process is a sequence of generic iterations, each with two steps: 1. IdeaStep:Observethepresentstateoftheideaandthinktoarriveatanactionorset of actions that, if executed, is likely to result in progress to a Finished Idea. 2. Action Step: Execute the actions decided in the Idea Step. If a Finished Idea has been achieved, stop. Otherwise return to the Idea Step and start the next iteration.53 I term this process the diaconatic. It’s based on the Latin “dia” for “through” and “conatus” for “attempt or struggle.” The literal translation of diaconatic, then, is “through struggle.” It’s a variation of the term “dialectic” which is loosely translated “through speaking.” I like this model for two reasons. First, it’s a simple descriptive model that seems to apply to all ideation. It applies to ideation in the arts, the sciences, engineering, the professions, and the trades. Essentially, it has mathematicians and artists thinking the same way. Secondly, there is an explicit Action Step where the thinker engages with the world. In this way, it’s clear that ideation is an embodied process. In most cases, a thinker cannot predict precisely the results of the actions he or she decides to execute. I refer to this characteristic of a thinker’s cognition as opaque foresight. Based on expertise (largely experience and knowledge), he or she has an inkling of what will happen but there is usually not certainty. This uncertainty begets the experimental nature of the diaconatic. Invariably the Action Step will require an interaction with the environment outside the mind, and very often, this occurs through the hands, much as it did 2.5 million years ago when we first started to manufacture stone tools. This could be running an experiment, or reading a relevant book, or writing the prose of a final paper. Yes, we do spend periods of time stationary and thinking hard. But any serious ideation over an extended period requires use of our hands. Implicit in the diaconatic is the information flow from the environment to the thinker. For example, an artist doing a painting might decide to do a series of brush strokes at the Idea Step and then execute those steps at the Action Step. At the next Idea Step, he or she will 53 Readers familiar with mathematical programming will recognize this ideation process as similar to a gradient search algorithm. With gradient search, a direction is chosen and then a step-length is chosen to maximize (or minimize) the change in the objective function value. Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 135 assess the strokes just completed and then decide what to do next. In this way, the environ- ment provides the thinker feedback, or equivalently, a message. When the Wrights made an alteration to their design, they tried it out to see how it would work. I’ve borrowed the idea of “message” from Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980 CE) who wrote about the effects of communication media in his book Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man.54 Whereas McLuhan was primarily interested in the effects of media on communication, my focus is the effects of media (particularly exographics) on ideation. There is a parallel. The diaconatic involves our “communication” with the world around us and it is through the message/feedback system that we actually have this “conversation.” We try an idea whose effects are, a priori, unpredictable (i. e., a chord progression on a guitar) and once the environment communicates the result (the sound of the chords travelling to our ears), we carry on. A number of scholars have presented other descriptive models of the general phases of ideation as a thinker works to a Finished Idea. Graham Wallas thought there were four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.55 I’ll suggest only two: Preparation and Execution. The Preparation Phase is where a thinker studies his or her problem and contemplates a way forward. Armed with this general plan, he or she then enters the Execution Phase where the idea is developed and hopefully finalized. An exam- ple is the ideation process of artists. The Canadian magical realist, Alex Colville, spent a lot of time preparing to do each of his paintings. In a paper appearing in Nature, Martin Kemp described Colville’s approach for one painting, The Surveyor.56 It involved making 30 drawings over 14 months over 1999–2000. Most of the drawings were made with an engineer’s drafting tools. In Kemp’s words: A complex fretwork of lines drawn with straight-edge and compasses is intricately interwoven with the subjects . . . Tones and colours are positioned to see what works . . . calculations of scale keep everything in proportion.57 So we know a lot about Colville’s technique. Certainly the preparation of the surface on which Colville would paint required an engineer’s drawing tools and a lot of time. But the real point is the preparation. Before Colville painted his first stroke, there was a lot of prepa- ration. Picasso went through the same sort of process preparing to paint Les Desmoiselles. To be clear, the Preparation and Execution Stages are simply a way to characterize the long sequence of diaconatic iterations required to get to the Finished Idea. The initial set of diaconatic iterations are those of the Preparation Stage and the remaining iterations are those of the Execution Stage. 54 Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1994 edition). 55 Graham Wallas, The Art of Thought (Kent: Solis Press, 1926/2014). 56 Martin Kemp, “A Measured Approach: Alex Colville’s Exhaustive Search for Mathematical Probity,” Nature 430 (2004). 57 Kemp, “A Measured Approach,” 969. 136 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 6.10 Serious Ideation and Important Ideas As I remarked in Chapter 1, all of us ideate. Every day, we think and make important deci- sions. A doctor might make a diagnosis. A lawyer writes a factum. A mechanic might decide that a car needs a new part. Over our history, some ideas have been assessed to be great ideas. Let’s look at some of the important aspects of these ideas. First, the gestation period for important ideas is usually measured in years. The Wright brothers were experienced technologists in 1899 when they decided to tackle powered flight. Four years later, they took their historic flight at Kitty Hawk. Darwin worked his adult life on the ideas which led to the theory of evolution.58 He published The Origin of Species at age 50. It took Neil Simon (1929–2018 CE) 3 years and 22 rewrites before his first play, Come Blow Your Horn, was performed on Broadway.59 In the late thirties, John Steinbeck (1902–1969 CE) wrote The Grapes of Wrath, a novel for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. After writing the first 70,000 words, he destroyed them and started over. Second, and not surprisingly, there are a significant number of diaconatic iterations required to produce an important idea. The Israeli novelist Amos Oz (1939–2018 CE) described his craft this way: It is like reconstructing the whole of Paris from Lego bricks. It’s about three- quarters-of-a-million small decisions.60 This large number of iterations is sometimes a matter of high art. Here is Neil Simon describ- ing his requirement to get the music and rhythm of the words right: I want to make sure every word is right. Cause I don’t want to have to retype it again. I don’t mean spelled right. But getting the right amount of syllables, words. Sometimes you write a sentence and you say “I’ve said everything I want in this sentence” but it needs another word and it has to do with the music of it . . um . . it has to do with the beats in it. It’s not a conscious thought but I read it and I say something is wrong here. Sometimes it has an extra word in it that I don’t need. People like Jack Lemmon I’ve seen in print and he’s said it on television a number of times is that with Neil Simon’s work because of the rhythm he works in you can’t leave out a preposition or an “an”, “if”, “and” or “but” not because the word is important but because it’s part of the music and he says I’ve tried taking it out but it doesn’t work so I put it back in.61 58 James Costa has written an excellent short history of the development of the idea. See “The Darwinian Revelation: Trac- ing the Origin and Evolution of an Idea,” BioScience 59, no. 10 (2009). 59 Neil Simon, Memoirs (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2017), 37. 60 Roger Cohen, “A Time for Traitors,” New York Times, January 3, 2015: 17. 61 https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=S6GEuOOm6hA. Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation 137 Third, some Idea Steps are long. Charles Dickens reported this while working on Barn- aby Rudge: I didn’t stir out yesterday, but sat and thought all day; not writing a line; not so much as the cross of a t or dot of an i. I imaged forth a good deal of Barnaby by keeping my mind steadily upon him.62 This accords with Newton’s characterization of his process: “I keep the subject constantly before me, and wait ‘till the first dawnings open slowly, by little and little, into a full and clear light.” Fourth, there is bilevel control of the Idea Step of each diaconatic iteration, a concept we first came upon in Chapter 2. The thinker usually has an over-arching idea and an implicit or explicit high-level plan which guides each decision at each Idea Step. For example, in the planning of the David, Michelangelo (1475–1564 CE) undertook sketches and then produced smaller-scaled wax and clay models of what he had in mind. These then guided him when he focussed on the detail of the plan. So, while carving the middle toe of the left foot, he could focus on this detail to the exclusion of everything else. Basically, decisions at the Idea Step are only loosely constrained by the high-level plan. Neil Simon did not have a complete high- level plan. He began writing his plays with only ideas for the characters and the start of the plot but had no idea how the plot would progress or end. He is on record as saying that his plays ended when he centered “Curtain” on a line. As it turns out, we have built-in cognitive skills that help our high-level control. For example, we have an ability to track the gist of an idea. If I’ve just finished reading a novel, I can give you an overview of the plot and describe the characters but there is no way that I can recall the contents of the second paragraph on page 107. This is sometimes called the verbatim effect, the idea that narrative is much easier to remember than, say, a grocery list. Visually we do something similar. We tend to see the gestalt or the whole before the individual parts making up the whole. 6.11 Faulkner and the Right Stuff The novelist William Faulkner (1897–1962 CE) once said this at a press conference: At one time I thought the most important thing was talent. I think now that—the young man or the young woman must possess or teach himself, train himself, in infinite patience, which is to try and to try and to try until it comes right. He must train himself in ruthless intolerance. That is, to throw away anything that is false no matter how much he might love that page or that paragraph. The most important thing is insight, that is . . . curiosity to wonder, to mull, and to muse why 62 Harry Stone, Dickens’ Working Notes for His Novels (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), xii. 138 Chapter 6 Individual Imagination and Ideation it is that man does what he does. And if you have that, then I don’t think the talent makes much difference, whether you’ve got that or not.63 Faulkner lays out two qualities that all great thinkers appear to share. First there is the hard work of the diaconatic, the willingness to stay at it until it’s right. Second is the dogged curi- osity and determination to figure out what is driving the phenomenon under consideration. I haven’t talked about this point and won’t say much more about it, but attitude is crucial. If a thinker is to ideate successfully, he or she must have the right attitude and a huge part of that attitude is perseverance. 63 University of Virginia, May 20, 1957.","length":85641,"tokens":19453,"chunks":[{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"I shut my eyes in order to see.

Sometimes the gesture is repeated if there is no reaction. Scientists also look at the nature of the response to make sure they are classifying the meaning of the signal properly. It’s worth noting that, with instruction, non-human primates appear to be capable of sym- bolic communication.

As a warning signal, they will sometimes bare their canines. Interestingly, when humans use threatening language, we sometimes bare our canines as the threat is uttered.

Blockers, who are also high up in adjacent trees, try to funnel them. The ambusher on the ground observes this funnel starting and the direction of a target colobus’s movement. He then runs ahead and selects a tree that the colobus is likely to get to, climbs it, and hides waiting for the colobus to arrive.

By his admission, he was influenced by the thinking of the economist Thomas Malthus on population. Malthus was aware of the role of famine and disease in limiting population growth.

Another example of analogical “aha” thinking comes from the Wright brothers and their decision to warp the wings of their glider to affect a change in direction. We know that they looked at James Pettigrew’s book on animal locomotion.37 In Wilbur’s notebook dated September-October 1900, he made the following observation about a gliding pigeon: Moreover, the oscillations of lateral balance are so rapid that gravity alone could not possibly produce them.","content_length":792,"content_tokens":163,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"The bird certainly twists its wing tips so that the wind strikes one wing on top and the other on its lower side, thus by force changing the bird’s lateral position.38 The bird’s movement of its wingtips in the opposite directions (one up, the other down) led to wing warping and modern ailerons. This is analogical thinking. In summary, coming up with ideas is sometimes a case of discovering patterns and regu- larities that are hidden from our direct sight. As I have argued above, it is our imagination with our System 2 machinery engaged which leads to new ideas. How do our imaginations come up with these ideas?

Regarding cues, the decision-maker needs to be able to recognize them and then act on them. There is no need for he or she to be able to explain the nature of the cues and how they work.

Let’s look at the ML in more detail. If we look at great thinkers, their experiences are all pretty much the same. Each has made a substantial investment in internalizing the knowledge and methods of his or her expertise. Moreover, this process usually occurs over a significant period of time and is fuelled by a single-minded intellectual curiosity that sometimes dominates his or her life.","content_length":905,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"What does it mean to internalize knowledge and methods? By knowledge, I mean that your memory contains a large number of facts in your area of expertise. A physicist will have a good working knowledge of calculus. A good lawyer will know the law in his or her area of practice. A neurologist trains for years to develop an intimate understanding of neurological disorders. By method, I mean that a thinker is knowledgeable about techniques to create new ideas in his or her area of expertise. An historian is taught how to find and interpret original written sources to arrive at new interpretations of significant historical events. An accoun- tant is taught how to apply accounting principles so that he or she can arrive at reasonable assessments of a firm’s or individual’s financial position.

The key word, though, is the internalization of knowledge and method and this is best understood in what it is not. In my view, the next big idea in an area of expertise is not likely to come from a Google search. Yes, machines in aid of memory and recall are important. But in the production of ideas, there is no machine that is a substitute for a mind able to examine seemingly different objects internally.

To me, the essence of internalization is seen in an expert chess player. The evidence suggests that, over long years of study and play, a player effectively rewires his or her head. This rewiring leads to good move selections, the hallmark of an expert chess player. 6.9 The Diaconatic If we observed a thinker in the act of ideation and recorded what she was doing over time, we would see her alternating between two activities.","content_length":794,"content_tokens":163,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"One would be a planning effort where she’s at rest thinking about the problem and what to do next; the other would be an action activity where she engages with the external environment, usually with her hands, to make the adjustment called for by her thinking over the planning effort. For example, a novel- ist might alternate between thinking about what to write and writing what that thinking suggested. In this section, I’ll suggest a model of the ideation process—the diaconatic—which follows a sequence of these alternating planning and action activities. Before I do that, let’s consider the processes of several thinkers. Orville and Wilbur Wright We have already considered the Wrights. Their four-year process of coming to understand the principles of powered flight was surely a sequence of planning/action activities.

Over the four years, the Wright brothers would have executed thousands of iterations of this cycle of plan/action steps.

But to this point, we really haven’t figured out much about how it gives rise to our thoughts in a way that would benefit this inquiry. What is needed is a simple descriptive model. As described in the previous section, ideation seems to follow an experimental search. It requires us to do a series of iterations where, at each iteration, we decide what to do next and then execute that decision. This idea/action sequence recurs until the thinker gets to a finished idea. More formally, I propose that ideation process is a sequence of generic iterations, each with two steps: 1.","content_length":786,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"IdeaStep:Observethepresentstateoftheideaandthinktoarriveatanactionorset of actions that, if executed, is likely to result in progress to a Finished Idea. 2. Action Step: Execute the actions decided in the Idea Step. If a Finished Idea has been achieved, stop. Otherwise return to the Idea Step and start the next iteration.53 I term this process the diaconatic. It’s based on the Latin “dia” for “through” and “conatus” for “attempt or struggle.” The literal translation of diaconatic, then, is “through struggle.” It’s a variation of the term “dialectic” which is loosely translated “through speaking.” I like this model for two reasons.

Essentially, it has mathematicians and artists thinking the same way. Secondly, there is an explicit Action Step where the thinker engages with the world. In this way, it’s clear that ideation is an embodied process. In most cases, a thinker cannot predict precisely the results of the actions he or she decides to execute. I refer to this characteristic of a thinker’s cognition as opaque foresight. Based on expertise (largely experience and knowledge), he or she has an inkling of what will happen but there is usually not certainty. This uncertainty begets the experimental nature of the diaconatic. Invariably the Action Step will require an interaction with the environment outside the mind, and very often, this occurs through the hands, much as it did 2.5 million years ago when we first started to manufacture stone tools.","content_length":927,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"This could be running an experiment, or reading a relevant book, or writing the prose of a final paper. Yes, we do spend periods of time stationary and thinking hard. But any serious ideation over an extended period requires use of our hands.

For example, an artist doing a painting might decide to do a series of brush strokes at the Idea Step and then execute those steps at the Action Step. At the next Idea Step, he or she will 53 Readers familiar with mathematical programming will recognize this ideation process as similar to a gradient search algorithm.

There is a parallel. The diaconatic involves our “communication” with the world around us and it is through the message/feedback system that we actually have this “conversation.” We try an idea whose effects are, a priori, unpredictable (i.","content_length":765,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"e., a chord progression on a guitar) and once the environment communicates the result (the sound of the chords travelling to our ears), we carry on. A number of scholars have presented other descriptive models of the general phases of ideation as a thinker works to a Finished Idea. Graham Wallas thought there were four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.55 I’ll suggest only two: Preparation and Execution. The Preparation Phase is where a thinker studies his or her problem and contemplates a way forward. Armed with this general plan, he or she then enters the Execution Phase where the idea is developed and hopefully finalized. An exam- ple is the ideation process of artists.

In Kemp’s words: A complex fretwork of lines drawn with straight-edge and compasses is intricately interwoven with the subjects    Tones and colours are positioned to see what works    calculations of scale keep everything in proportion.57 So we know a lot about Colville’s technique. Certainly the preparation of the surface on which Colville would paint required an engineer’s drawing tools and a lot of time. But the real point is the preparation.

The Wright brothers were experienced technologists in 1899 when they decided to tackle powered flight. Four years later, they took their historic flight at Kitty Hawk. Darwin worked his adult life on the ideas which led to the theory of evolution.58 He published The Origin of Species at age 50. It took Neil Simon (1929–2018 CE) 3 years and 22 rewrites before his first play, Come Blow Your Horn, was performed on Broadway.59 In the late thirties, John Steinbeck (1902–1969 CE) wrote The Grapes of Wrath, a novel for which he won the Pulitzer Prize.","content_length":867,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Individual Imagination and Ideation","content":"After writing the first 70,000 words, he destroyed them and started over.

The Israeli novelist Amos Oz (1939–2018 CE) described his craft this way: It is like reconstructing the whole of Paris from Lego bricks. It’s about three- quarters-of-a-million small decisions.60 This large number of iterations is sometimes a matter of high art. Here is Neil Simon describ- ing his requirement to get the music and rhythm of the words right: I want to make sure every word is right. Cause I don’t want to have to retype it again. I don’t mean spelled right. But getting the right amount of syllables, words. Sometimes you write a sentence and you say “I’ve said everything I want in this sentence” but it needs another word and it has to do with the music of it   um   it has to do with the beats in it.

The thinker usually has an over-arching idea and an implicit or explicit high-level plan which guides each decision at each Idea Step. For example, in the planning of the David, Michelangelo (1475–1564 CE) undertook sketches and then produced smaller-scaled wax and clay models of what he had in mind.

He is on record as saying that his plays ended when he centered “Curtain” on a line. As it turns out, we have built-in cognitive skills that help our high-level control. For example, we have an ability to track the gist of an idea.

Second is the dogged curi- osity and determination to figure out what is driving the phenomenon under consideration. I haven’t talked about this point and won’t say much more about it, but attitude is crucial.

At the time they were rescued, they had been on the island for 33 days, surviving on coconuts, conchs, and rats. Let’s think about this for a moment supposing you and I had arrived on the island with just the clothes on our backs, soaking wet. What would we do? It seems to me there would be three immediate priorities: water, food, and shelter. Once we figured these out, we could start thinking about how to get off the island. Let’s consider the problem of water. It would be my first concern because I’ve experi- enced severe dehydration. Besides being life-threatening, it’s painful: your head begins to feel like it’s in a vice. We can’t drink seawater because it’s toxic to humans. So where do we get fresh water? We could explore the island to see if there were any freshwater sources. Could we build some sort of distillation method? The little I know of distillation, we’d have to build a fire and then mcgyver some containers to catch the distillate. How would we build 1 Marie Fazio, “3 People Stranded on Uninhabited Island Are Rescued After 33 Days,” NY Times, Feb 10, 2021 (https:// www. nytimes. com/2021/02/10/us/bahamas-coast-guard-rescue. html?surface=most-popular&fellback=false&req_ id=773102923&algo=top_conversion&variant=3_top_conversion_daysback_4&imp_id=972614109&action=click& module=Most%20Popular&pgtype=Homepage). 139 140 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation a fire? From my scout days, I remember that you begin with two sticks and some very fine, dry grasses. The hope would be to get an ember that could then be used to light the grasses. Keep in mind that the clock is ticking because our activities to find water require muscle movement and therefore hydration. What the Anguilla Cay Crusoes did was drink coconut milk, which is 50% water. This exercise got me to thinking about my own water supply. It’s a matter of a few seconds for me to get a glass of water. I know very little about the production of this water. I certainly didn’t plumb our house or install the supply line from the house to the street to pick up the city supply. I have only a limited knowledge of how the city water system works. Obvi- ously, there is an organization responsible for its construction, operation, and maintenance. The city gets its water from Lake Ontario and I’m confident that there is some sort of water purification process between the lake and my tap. In contrast to my limited knowledge of water, consider what Ju/’hoansi bushmen know. Participating in a persistence run with the Ju/’hoansi, the biologist, Louis Leibenberg had become dangerously dehydrated and didn’t have any water. He and the two Ju/’hoansi he was with had just run down a kudu and killed it. Liebenberg realized he was in trouble when he stopped sweating. He writes: I asked if I could drink the stomach water of the kudu to quench my thirst. I had drunk the stomach water of gemsbok on a previous hunt, and although it tasted like rotting grass soup, it was not too bad. At this stage I was so thirsty that taste was not much of a concern. But !Nate said that I would die if I drank it, because the kudu was feeding on a leaf that is poisonous to humans.2 Eventually one of the Ju/’hoansi ran back to the village and came back with enough water to restore Liebenberg. The point is that the Ju/’hoansi have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the ecosystem they inhabit. As I have explained, I know little about my water other than how to consume it and how to call a plumber if my system breaks down. Both of my “skills” were learned culturally, by imitation. If you see your mother and father operate the tap, most of us are smart enough to put two and two together. Clearly there is a lot of cultural knowledge that goes into construct- ing a large, modern water system. It is knowledge that has accumulated with every improve- ment to these systems over many years. But I don’t need to know any of it. Certainly the city water engineer does. I don’t. Significantly, these points about water also apply to just about every other cultural idea and artifact I experience in my life. There is a lot of cultural information in each of these arti- facts. Just imagine what would happen if there was some cataclysmic accident and only a few of us survive. How could we ever reproduce the culture that we enjoyed before the accident? The answer is that it would be impossible. 2 Louis Liebenberg, The Origin of Science: The Evolutionary Roots of Scientific Reasoning and Its Implications for Citizen Science (Capetown: CyberTracker, 2013), 20, available at: https://www. cybertracker. org/science/the-origin-of-science. Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 141 There are at least four summary points to make. First culture is cumulative. As a species, we pay attention and if some of us can improve some aspect of culture with a good idea then we “suggest” it and maybe our improvement gets adopted. For example, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot (1725–1804 CE) built a steam-powered tractor for the French Army in 1769. Since that time, we’ve improved vehicles continuously with a host of minor changes and some major changes. In addition to the vehicles themselves, we have a large support system includ- ing gas stations, repair shops, massive road systems, government organizations for licensing and safety, and the legal system to adjudicate how to sort out fault in accidents among other things. Our investment in vehicle ideation has been massive. Again, I have no idea how to build a car much less how to put together any of the support arrangements. Culturally a car represents 250 years of ideation and I only know how to drive, fix a flat, and check fluid levels. My societal role with cars is only to buy and drive them. Here again, to be able to do this, I learned by imitation with some verbal instruction. Grow- ing up, I watched my father drive and when he gave me the wheel, I knew enough to put it in R to back out of the driveway. The point of this discussion is that we now live in a society where we are highly depen- dent on one another. Clearly this dependence is the result of cooperation. We cooperate like no other species on the planet. With most other primate species, cooperation extends only to your immediate family. But with us, everybody cooperates. The other day, I was leaving a parking lot downtown, and there was an hour left on the parking ticket I had purchased. I gave it to a woman I had never met and am not likely to meet again. The first to recognize the importance of cooperation to culture was the Soviet psychol- ogist, Lev Vygotsky.3 He did his research and publishing early in the 20th century in the Soviet Union and eventually his work made its way to the West. The more recent thinking is the work of Merlin Donald, Michael Tomasello, and most especially, Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich.4 7.2 Distributed Cognition I’ve argued that exographics is necessary to discover certain kinds of ideas. I’ve also stressed the importance of the social aspects of ideation. It’s just not possible for one of us to go into the skunkworks, work for a period of time, and then get into the rocket we’ve built and go to the 3 Lev Vygotsky, Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978). 4 Merlin Donald, Origins of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the Evolution of Culture and Cognition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991); Michael Tomasello, The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999); Michael Tomasello, A Natural History of Human Thinking (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014); Joseph Henrich, The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017); Robert Boyd, A Different Kind of Animal: How Culture Transformed Our Species (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017); and Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd, Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2005). 142 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation moon. Hence many kinds of ideation are necessarily social and they require us to use cogni- tive tools external to our mind (like exographics). One of the first to argue this idea was the anthropologist Edwin Hutchins and I’ve already mentioned his book, Cognition in the Wild.5 Let’s look at a few examples beginning with the main example in Hutchins’s book. Charles Bazerman offers a nice summary of it: Hutchins makes this argument explicitly only in the short closing chapter “Cultural Cognition.” Until that point Hutchins has painstakingly constructed a 350 page description of an actually occurring situated intelligent activity, carried out collaboratively in a concrete material setting by socially related individuals working within a structured organization, embedded within an elaborate culture and employing historically developed cultural tools, both material and symbolic. That is, Hutchins describes with ethnographic detail how a navigation crew on the naval vessel U. S. S. Palau guides that amphibious helicopter transport ship through San Diego harbor.6 The navigation of the ship requires a network of minds and this network has to have access to material tools to guide the ship safely. Sailing the U. S. S. Palau is not a one-man one-hand- on-the-tiller job. One of Hutchins’s interesting examples is the problem of how the ship’s speed is deter- mined. Suppose the problem is this: get the speed of a vessel which travels 1,500 yards in 3 minutes. (Note that a nautical mile is 2,000 yards and speed is usually measured in knots, the number of nautical miles traveled in an hour.) One way to do this problem is with some arithmetic. Since I go 1,500 yards in 3 minutes, I’d go 30,000 yards in 60 minutes (multiply both by 20). 30,000 yards is 30,000/2,000 = 15 knots. Another way to do the problem is the way experienced mariners would do it. There is a “three-minute rule” which requires you to take the distance in yards traveled in 3 minutes and divide it by 100 to get the velocity. So, in this case, you would get 1,500/100 = 15 knots. Still another solution approach would be to use a nomograph. In this case, there would be three logarithmic scales and if you knew 2 values (in this case distance and time), you would use a straight edge to connect those two, and then the straight edge would give you the speed on the third axis. In each of these approaches, you are doing a fundamentally different calculation. Clearly your cognition to get the speed is situationally and culturally determined. Another example comes from professional golf. For an approach shot to a green, a PGA Tour professional typically goes through a process with his caddie to determine what club 5 See Edwin Hutchins, Cognition in the Wild (Cambrige: MIT Press, 1995), and for a piece on distributed cognition that brings in the importance of exographics, see Merlin Donald, “The Exographic Revolution: Neuropsychological Sequelae,” in The Cogntive Life of Things: Recasting the Boundaries of the Mind, eds. Lambros Malafouris and Colin Refrew (Cambridge: McDonald Institute Monographs, 2010). 6 Charles Bazerman, “Review Symposium: Review Symposium: Cognition in the Wild,” Mind, Culture, and Activity 3, no. 1 (Cambridge, MIT Press. 1995): 51. Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 143 and shot to hit. This begins with both working out the yardage to the pin in their yardage books after at least one of them paces off a yardage to a landmark. They then take into account slope, wind, and sometimes air temperature to decide what club and shape of shot to hit. There is a back and forth until the golfer decides what he is going to do. What we have here is a network of minds using material tools (including exographics) to make the decision. 7.3 Shared Intentionality You can learn a lot about our sociality from one remarkable experiment. I’ve seen versions of it in a number of YouTube videos and in print.7 One version opens with a 15-month-old boy mind- ing his business, hanging on to his mother’s hand. Next you see an adult experimenter walk by the boy and his mother carrying a pile of magazines. The boy observes him walk to a bookcase, place the magazines on a shelf, and then close the doors of the bookcase. The experimenter then goes back to the entrance of the room and picks up another pile of magazines, carrying them with both hands under the pile. He walks back to the bookcase (recall the doors are closed), just stands there for a second, and then takes a step back. The child sees this, immediately let’s go of his mother’s hand, walks to the bookcase, and opens the doors. The experimenter then takes a step forward, puts the pile in the bookcase, and then closes the bookcase doors again. Once more the experimenter goes back to the entrance of the room, picks up another pile of magazines in the same way, and begins to walk back towards the bookcase. The child sees this, immediately goes to the bookcase and opens the doors so that the experimenter can deposit this third pile of magazines into the bookcase as soon as he gets there. Let’s consider what is going through the boy’s mind as this experiment progresses. In the experimenter’s first pass, the boy is interested in what the experimenter is trying to do. He observes what the experimenter does and infers that the experimenter’s goal is to move the magazines to the bookcase. On the experimenter’s second pass, the boy watches the experi- menter and correctly concludes that not only does the experimenter want to open the doors of the bookcase, but also that he can’t do it because both his hands are tied up holding the books. The boy concludes that the doors need to be opened and goes ahead and does this for the experimenter. This is key: the boy not only sees what needs to be done but he engages will- ingly to help. In the last pass, the boy understands completely what the experimenter wants to do. Once he sees the experimenter start to move with the third load, he anticipates the experi- menter is going to have the same difficulty as on the second pass and so goes immediately to the bookcase to open it ahead of the experimenter arriving. The key to appreciating the behaviour of the little boy is to understand what would hap- pen if a chimpanzee were placed in the same situation. Given what I know, a chimpanzee wouldn’t be the least bit interested in helping. At best, it would just glance at the experimenter 7 See https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=8RxCOW2c-hI, Michael Tomasello Lecture 3—Ontogenetic Emergence, at 59:46. 144 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation as he stood in front of the closed bookshelf. Is it because chimpanzees are lazy or stupid? Hardly. It’s just that they don’t possess some of the important social skills that allow humans to cooperate in ways no other species can. Michael Tomasello has referred to this ability in the little boy as shared intentionality.8 It comprises two components. First, it’s a suite of skills that enable the boy to understand the intentions of others and second, it includes the boy’s intrinsic motivation to help, to cooper- ate, and to collaborate. Shared intentionality refines our notion of human cooperation. There are other good examples. Suppose a primary school teacher is assigned the task of teaching 30 young chimpanzees how to read in a classroom setting. Primatologists tell us that it would be impossible to get them all to sit at their desks much less pay attention to what the teacher is saying. As Tomasello has suggested, could you imagine two chimpanzees going for a walk together? Or suppose I ask you “Do you have the time please?” N. J. Enfield argues that this creates an obligation in you to respond.9 You can’t just look at me. You have to at least say “No, I don’t,” and more probably, you’d say “No I don’t. Sorry.” When it comes to shared intentionality, Helen Keller (1880–1968 CE) is the poster-child. As a result of an illness at 19 months, she lost her sight and hearing permanently. The rest of her story is well known. Anne Sullivan was put in charge of her care and education. In time, Keller graduated from Radcliffe and, over her life, wrote 12 books. If shared intentionality is an innate desire to connect with others and contribute, Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan are great examples. 7.4 Theory of Mind One of the cognitive skills associated with shared intentionality is our ability to “read” minds, to understand another’s intentions, needs, desires. As described in the previous sec- tion, even very young children exhibit this skill, a skill referred to as theory of mind (ToM) in the psychology literature. To me, the term really doesn’t capture what is going on. Let me try to clarify. We all experience thoughts, beliefs, desires, feelings, etc. and these are our own. Nobody else knows what’s going on in my head unless I choose to reveal it, although some- times I can reveal what I’m thinking without speaking. For example, a friend of mine always breathes more heavily when he has a good poker hand. When I see/hear this, I generally fold. I know that others experience the same sort of internal intellectual life that I do and I know that they know I experience the same things that they do. In sum, we are all aware of each other’s internal intellectual and emotional life. This is what “theory of mind” means. Some have suggested the term “mind-reading” but I’m not sure that picks up the essence of the idea either. To me, it should be something like “other mind awareness.” 8 Michael Tomasello, Malinda Carpenter, Josep Call, Tanya Behne, and Henrike Moll, “Understanding and Sharing Inten- tions: The Origins of Cultural Cognition,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 28, no. 5 (2005). 9 N. J. Enfield, How We Talk: The Inner Workings of Conversation (New York: Basic Book, 2017), 18. Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 145 My wife, Deb and I get up very early in the morning but usually not quite at the same time. At this time of day, our main activity is to read with some conversation depending on the contents of the morning newspapers. Whoever gets up first puts on the coffee. On the days when I am last into the kitchen, sometimes it will be shortly after Deb settles into her chair in our reading room adjacent to the kitchen. On these mornings, I bring her coffee in to her. But one morning, without thinking, I poured only my cup and went into the reading room. Just as I was sitting down, I saw her head come up. She stared at me and then put her head to the side and immediately I knew what the problem was. With that look she might as well have said “You dummy! Where is my bloody coffee!!” So as I got up, I said “Sorry dear,” went to the kitchen, and brought back her coffee. As I handed it to her, I said, “Jeesh, you didn’t have to swear at me like that!” We both laughed. When I teach students, either in class or individually, I am trying to impart mathematics knowledge. Let’s narrow the focus to a one-on-one session at the blackboard. I’ll write some- thing on the board, perhaps an equation, and then look at the student’s face. I am trying to get some indication that he or she understands what I’ve written. If the student fixes his or her gaze at what I’ve written and maintains that gaze, then I know they haven’t understood. Had the student understood, he or she would have indicated that immediately. In the case where there is a pregnant pause, I might say “See that?” and that’s my invitation to the student to explain what the issue is if they don’t understand. At that point the student will continue to look at the board, pointing at various parts, to explain, as best he or she can, what he or she does not see. When they’ve finished, they look at my face to get some indication from my expression whether I’ve understood their issue. It goes back and forth like this until there is a resolution of the issue or the student gives up trying to understand. One tends to think of communication as language but it’s a lot more as the two anecdotes above suggest. There can be lots of communication without language. Interested readers are referred to Edward Hall’s work and most especially his book, The Silent Language.10 The False Belief Test Imagine the following experimental situation. Alice and Erin are each playing with a toy while David is sitting quietly apart from them watching them. All are three years old. There is a box close to Alice and a basket close to Erin. Alice takes the toy she is playing with, puts it into the box, and then leaves the room. While Alice is out of the room, Erin takes Alice’s toy from the box and puts it into the basket. Now suppose that an experimenter tells David that Alice is going to come back into the room and get her toy. The experimenter then asks David where Alice is going to look first. If David is a typical three-year-old, he will answer the basket. But if he were five-years old, he would answer the box. Psychologists attribute the difference to the development of David’s “theory of mind (ToM).” As a three-year-old, he thinks everybody else has the same knowledge of the world 10 Edward Hall, The Silent Language (New York: Doubleday, 1959). 146 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation he does. This is why he thinks that Alice would go to the basket when she gets back to the room. However, at age five, his ToM abilities would have developed to the point where he would realize that Alice couldn’t possibly know that Erin had moved the toy and would answer that Alice would first look in the box. In this way, we say that David is aware that other people can have false beliefs, which is why this particular test is called the false belief test. Autism An important source of evidence comes from autistic individuals, a condition that generally leads to some form of social impairment. These range from those who are quite severely impaired (e. g., the child who rocks back and forth, does not make eye contact, is prone to out- bursts and has difficulty speaking) to those with Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) or those judged to be High Functioning Autistic (HFA). AS and HFA individuals tend to be socially isolated and have obsessive interests. In fact, some are highly creative. There is evidence that Newton, Michelangelo, Mozart, Darwin, and Einstein were all “on the spectrum,” a phrase indicating that an individual suffers some level of social impairment. Michael Fitzgerald has written an interesting book, Autism and Creativity, on the possibility of the connection between autism and exceptional ability.11 The Heider Simmel Experiment Our willingness to attribute ToM is nicely illustrated with the Heider Simmel experiments.12 Experimental subjects were shown a short, animated film consisting of three geometric shapes moving around a computer screen with a fixed, relatively large rectangle on the right of the screen. As the animation progresses, a small line segment on one side of the rectangle appears to hinge much like a door would and the shapes move in and out of the rectangle through the opening. If you want to see the animation, go to YouTube and use the search phrase “Heider Simmel animation.” Experimental subjects were asked to “write down what happened in the picture.” One subject answered as follows: A man has planned to meet a girl and the girl comes along with another man. The first man tells the second to go; the second tells the first, and he shakes his head. Then the two men have a fight, and the girl starts to go into the room to get out of the way and hesitates and finally goes in. She apparently does not want to be with the first man. The first man follows her into the room after having left the second in a rather weakened condition leaning on the wall outside the room. The girl gets worried and races from one corner to the other in the far part of 11 Michael Fitzgerald, Autism and Creativity (New York, Bruner-Routledge, 2004). 12 Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel, “An Experimental Study of Apparent Behavior,” The American Journal of Psychology 57, no. 2 (1944). Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 147 the room. Man number one, after being rather silent for a while, makes several approaches at her; but she gets to the corner across from the door, just as man number two is trying to open it. He evidently got banged around and is still weak from his efforts to open the door. The girl gets out of the room in a sudden dash just as man number two gets the door open. The two chase around the outside of the room together, followed by man number one. But they finally elude him and get away. The first man goes back and tries to open his door, but he is so blinded by rage and frustration that he cannot open it. So he butts it open and in a really mad dash around the room he breaks in first one wall and then another.13 In fact, 34 of the 35 subjects answered in a similar way: they saw the geometric shapes mov- ing around on the screen as animated beings. Only one subject answered with a description of the movement of the triangles and circle. And even this subject, at one point, referred to the large triangle as a “he.” This is a remarkable result—it’s easy for us attribute a mind and intentions to inanimate geometric shapes moving around on a computer screen! 7.5 The Mimetic Capacity We’ve developed a mimetic faculty, an ability to copy and imitate. In Poetics, Aristotle argues that it’s instinctual. He also felt that our reasoning ability derived from our ability to see an object as the imitation of another (as in analogical reasoning). The German philosopher, Walter Benjamin (1892–1940 CE), wrote this: Nature produces similarities; one need only think of mimicry. The highest capacity for producing similarities, however, is man’s. His gift for seeing similarity is nothing but a rudiment of the once powerful compulsion to become similar and to behave mimetically. There is perhaps not a single one of his higher functions in which his mimetic faculty does not play a decisive role.14 Subsequently he argued that the mimetic faculty is the ability to produce and recognize similarities or sameness. In his book, Mimesis and Alterity, the anthropologist, Michael Taussig, expands on Benjamin’s definition: . . . the faculty to copy, imitate, make models, explore difference, yield into and become Other. The wonder of mimesis lies in the copy drawing on the character of the original, to the point whereby the representation may even assume that character and that power.15 13 Heider and Simmel, “An Experimental Study,” 246–247. 14 Walter Benjamin, “On the Mimetic Faculty,” in Selected Writings, 1926–1934, translated by Rodney Livingstone and others, edited by Michael W. Jennings, Howard Eiland, and Gary Smith (Cambridge: Belknap Press, 1999). 15 Michael Taussig, Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses (New York: Routledge, 1993), xiii. 148 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation Taussig subsequently suggests that this mimetic faculty is a sixth sense. As these scholars have suggested, our mimetic faculty includes not only our ability to imitate but also the cognitive ability to see the similarity or sameness in a collection of objects. A good example of this is the assessment of relational match-to-sample problems, a concept we’ve already looked at. Recall that, if the sample is “AA” and the objects are “BB” and “CD,” then “AA” is judged to be the most similar to “BB”. This is a significant human cognitive skill: we’re able to see the sameness in collections of objects which are, on their face, different. Mimesis The ancient Greeks thought of mimesis as the imitation or representation of reality, usually in the context of literature and art. The idea dates at least to the Homeric Hymns (approximately 700 BCE). Gregory Nagy suggests that in the Hymn to Apollo, the Delian Maidens engage in mimesis.16 Both Plato (in Republic) and Aristotle (in Poetics) argue that the artist (in sculpture, wall paintings, mosaics, etc.) and poet (in drama) attempt to represent real-world phenomena. The Greek “Kouroi” statues of beardless, muscular youth are examples. There is a view among some art historians that the Kouroi sculptors had in mind an ideal form for youth and were try- ing to reproduce that form. They believed that beauty and truth were embodied in nature, and it was therefore a worthy objective to reproduce nature, albeit with embellishment. So, while mimesis means to imitate, it does not generally mean to produce an exact copy. Mime is a form of theater where the story is acted out with body gesture and facial expression without language. It dates to ancient Greece. Silent films of the early 20th century are good examples. The opening scene of A Dog’s Life (1918) has Charlie Chaplin playing one of his classic characters—The Tramp. He is sleeping in a fenced-in dirt yard and the fence has quite a few gaps and holes in it. He suddenly wakes up and mimes that he is cold. To “solve” the problem he pulls out a handkerchief, folds it up, and then stuffs it into a small hole in a fence board closest to the ground. He then gets back on his side and goes to sleep, content that the problem has been solved. We certainly enjoy stories and fantasies. Whether novels, plays, movies, videogames, daydreams (the thinking person’s television), etc., we spend an unusually large percent- age of our time consuming or generating fantasy.17 I can remember my experience reading Steinbeck’s The Red Pony when I was young. When the pony died, I was in tears, and this came because of the emotion induced by the pages of the book. Our story-telling impulse can also be found in our ability to generate scientific theory. To explain planetary motion, Newton hypothesized an invisible force called gravity. Physicists now suggest the key might be a small, massless particle called a graviton. However no physicist has ever observed a 16 Gregory Nagy, “The Delian Maidens and their Relevance to Choral Mimesis in Classical Drama,” Chapter 10 in Choral Mediations in Greek Tragedy, ed. Renaud Gagné and Marianne Hopman, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013). 17 Jonathan Gottschall, The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human (New York: Mariner Books, 2012). Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 149 graviton. Whatever the story, the graviton is a lot like Marley’s ghost: they’re both phantasms within phantasies. When an actor plays a part, it’s a mimetic act (acting) within a mimetic creation (the drama). Acting extends to everyday life. In As You Like It, Shakespeare has Jacques say this: “All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players; / They have their exits and their entrances; / And one man in his time plays many parts.” The sociologist Erving Goffman explored Shakespeare’s insight in his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.18 He saw us as wearing different dramatic masks depending on the social situation. For example, on a public transit bus, suppose you sit facing a stranger with a shopping bag between his feet. Would you look at him and say, “What’s in the bag?” Probably not. You wouldn’t because it’s not consistent with the social script you have to follow in that situation. It’s not just actors who act. We all act. Life is mimetic. Indigenous Peoples and the Mimetic Faculty There are interesting historical accounts of primitive peoples having a significant mimetic faculty. Here is one from Claude Levi-Strauss’s Tristes Tropiques: That the Nambikwara [an indigenous people of Brazil living in the Amazon Basin] could not write goes without saying. But they were also unable to draw, except for a few dots and zigzags on their calabashes. I distributed pencils and paper among them, none the less, as I had done with the Caduveo. At first they made no use of them. Then, one day, I saw that they were all busy drawing wavy horizontal lines on the paper. What were they trying to do? I could only conclude that they were writing or, more exactly, that they were trying to do as I did with my pencils. As I had never tried to amuse them with drawings, they could not conceive of any other use for this implement. The willingness of the Nambikwara to mimic Levi-Strauss’s writing is fascinating. Save for the chief, they had no idea of the purpose of writing but were quite prepared to imitate and take part, likely because they felt it was some sort of powerful magic. The Work of Children Children’s play involves significant exercise of their mimetic faculty. Vivian Paley docu- ments that they spend much of their time engaged in fantasy, easily suspending reality. She recounts a fantasy that some of her kindergarten students acted out after a reading of the story Cinderella: Child1: “Now I’m the tiny baby and you’re a big sister.” Child2: “We could both be two sisters and the baby isn’t borned yet.” 18 Erving Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (Garden City: Doubleday, 1959). 150 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation Child1: “Well, we need a dad then. Billy, are you the dad? You hafta say ‘Where’s the baby?’ and I hafta say ‘She’s not borned yet.’” Billy: “Where’s the baby?” Child 1: “She’s not borned yet. She’s getting out of her mother in one day.” Billy: “Then one day is over. I hear her crying.”19 Another example is from my experience when my boys, David and Matt, were young. Every winter, I built a rink in the backyard. One night, one of my RMC colleagues, Jack Brimberg, came over to play some shinny. Jack is a native Montrealer so knows how to play the game on outdoor rinks. After a period of warm-up, the boys suggested a game, them against us. Jack and I agreed and then Jack immediately declared that he was going to be Doug Gilmour (at the time, Gilmour was a great NHL player from our city, Kingston, and was a favourite of both my boys). Matt immediately objected “No, no! I want to be Doug Gilmour!” Jack shot back that he had declared first, and this entitled him to be Gilmour, a comeback he and I both would have made at Matt’s age (there are rules!). At this point, Matt offered a compromise: “Ok, ok. What about you be Doug and I’ll be Gilmour?” Mirror Neurons and the Mimetic Faculty There have now been a significant number of empirical studies which suggest we have a sub- conscious mimetic response to the behaviours and mannerisms of those we are with. When I watch violent movies, I rarely have a physical reaction to people killed by gunfire. What does get me is a body-part amputation usually in a scene where the bad guy is trying to get information from the good guy. An example is the ear amputation scene in Reservoir Dogs. The bad guy approaches the victim with a shaving razor. The camera pans away just before the razor is applied but the sound of the victim soon turns from a furious pleading to a primordial yell of pain. Then we see the bad guy walking away, blood soaked, with the ear in one hand. I’ve seen this movie a number of times and when I hear the yell of pain, I still have the same visceral reaction: I generally turn away, shudder, and my face contorts. I do this even though I know it’s just a movie and the ear never actually comes off. In the last twenty years, scientists have come up with a good reason why I have this reaction. It turns out that we all have a mirror neuron system (MNS). The neurons of these systems fire either when you execute a particular movement or when you watch another person executing the same movement. When we observe, it’s like our brains are “silently” mimicking the action another is doing. These neurons were first discovered by neurophysiologists in a study of the control of hand and mouth movements in macaque monkeys. There is now substantial evidence that 19 Vivian Paley, A Child’s Work: the Importance of Fantasy Play (Chicago: University of Chicago, 2004), 12–13. Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 151 humans have these systems too.20 Interestingly, it would appear that mirror neurons play a key role in language acquisition.21 Infants seem to develop a mimetic capability almost right away. In a classic paper, Andrew Meltzoff and Keith Moore write this: The newborns’ first response to seeing a particular facial gesture is activation of the corresponding body part. For example, when they see tongue protrusion, there is often a quieting of the movements of other body parts and an activation of tongue. They do not necessarily protrude the tongue during this initial phase, but may elevate it, wiggle it, or move it slightly in the oral cavity. Likewise, when shown lip protrusion, they produce a marked tension of the lips and even press them together before there is imitation of the movement. It is as if young infants isolate what part of their body to move before how to move it. We call this ‘organ identification’.22 They also have some remarkable photographs in which an infant is imitating the facial expression of the parent. Janine Oostenbroek et al. argue that this skill is developed over the first year of life.23 Infant chimpanzees also develop this facial mimicking skill quite quickly, suggesting that the MNS has been evolving for a while.24 Babies also simulate conversation with an adult by responding to an adult’s baby talk with their own meaningless babble when it’s their turn. The resulting conversation is very close to a real human conversation both in rhythm and exchange but, of course, it’s semantically meaningless. To summarize, think about the staggeringly complex accomplishment of an infant mimicking an adult. How does it know to stick out its tongue in response to a mother sticking out her tongue or to smile when a mother smiles? Children usually copy adults to a fault. There have now been a number of studies which roughly follow the same experimental methodology.25 A reward is put into a box and it can be retrieved by simply pulling down on the knob of a spring door, and holding the door open while reaching into the box with the other hand to retrieve the prize. An experimental 20 James Kilner and Roger Lemon, “What We Know Currently About Mirror Neurons,” Current Biology 23, no. 23 (2013); Francesco Ferrari and Giacomo Rizzolatti, “Mirror Neuron Research: The Past and the Future,” Philosophical Transac- tions of the Royal Society B Biological Science 369, no. 1644 (2014). 21 Hugo Théoret and Alvaro Pascual-Leone, “Language Acquisition: Do as You Hear,” Current Biology 12, no. 21 (2002). 22 Andrew Meltzoff and Keith Moore, “Explaining Facial Imitation: A Theoretical Model,” Early Development and Parent- ing 6, no. 3–4 (1997): 183. 23 Janine Oostenbroek, Thomas Suddendorf, Mark Nielsen, Jonathan Redshaw, Siobhan Kennedy-Costantini, Jacqueline Davis, Sally Clark, and Virginia Slaughter, “Comprehensive Longitudinal Study Challenges the Existence of Neonatal Imitation in Humans,” Current Biology 26, no. 10 (2016). 24 Masako Myowa-Yamakoshi, Masaki Tomonaga, Masayuki Tanaka, and Tetsuro Matsuzawa, “Imitation in Neonatal Chimpanzees (Pan Troglodytes),” Developmental Science 7, no. 4 (2004). 25 See, for example: Victoria Horner and Andrew Whiten, “Causal Knowledge and Imitation/Emulation Switching in Chimpanzees (Pan Troglodytes) and Children (Homo Sapiens),” Animal Cognition 8, no. 3 (2010); and Mark Nielsen and Keyan Tomaselli, “Overimitation in Kalahari Bushman Children and the Origins of Human Cultural Cognition,” Psychological Science 21, no. 5 (2010). 152 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation subject is given some time to experiment freely with the box and door to see how it works. Subsequently, the experimenter executes the following demonstration steps: Step 1. She takes a stick and, with it, traces two circles on top of the box. Step 2. Then, she places the stick on top of the knob and pushes it down to open the door. Step 3. Finally, while holding the door open with the stick, she reaches in with her other hand to claim the prize. After this demonstration, the experimental subject is given some time (usually a minute) to get the prize. No instructions are given as to how to do this and the experimental subject is free to choose any method to get the prize. There are two things about this methodology that are irrelevant to getting the prize: there is no need to trace two circles with the stick on top of the box; and there is no need to use the stick to hold open the door. Yet, when children do this experiment, almost all follow the exact method the experimenter demonstrates, includ- ing the irrelevant actions. This phenomenon where human children tend to follow a sequence of instructions which include irrelevant actions to achieve a goal is termed over-imitation. Chimpanzees have been subjected to the same experiment and they tend not to over- imitate. Generally, they engage in a set of actions which gets to the same goal without repro- ducing the actions of the demonstrator exactly.26 Relative to human children, chimpanzees are poor imitators. Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh tested our unconscious tendency to mimic in the following way.27 In an experiment, two persons were brought into a room. One was a subject of the experiment. The subject did not know that the second person was a confederate of the experimenters. They took turns describing a series of photographs. This subject-confederate dyad was under the supervision of an experimenter sitting behind a desk. The subject and confederate sat in chairs on the other side of the desk from the experimenter. The subject had a clear view of the confederate as they took turns describing the photographs. Each subject did two 10-minute sessions, each with a different confederate. In one of the sessions, the confederate rubbed his or her face frequently; in the other, he or she shook a foot, again frequently. The experimenters recorded the number of times that the subject rubbed his or her face in the particular session where the confederate did the same. Similarly, the experimenters recorded the number of times that the subject shook his or her foot in the particular session where the confederate did the same. Sure enough, subjects did more face rubbing in the presence of the face rubbing confed- erate and more foot shaking in the presence of the foot shaking confederate. Furthermore, 26 Francys Subiaul, “What’s Special about Human Imitation? A Comparison with Enculturated Apes,” Behavioral Sciences 6, no. 3 (2016). 27 Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh, “The Chameleon Effect: The Perception-Behavior Link and Social Interation,” Journal of Personality and Social Psycology 76, no. 6 (1999). Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 153 after the experiment in a debriefing, each of the 35 subjects was asked if they had noticed anything peculiar about the mannerisms of the confederate. One subject mentioned a par- ticular confederate’s hand gestures; two mentioned that confederates slouched when they sat. No subject mentioned either face rubbing or foot shaking. This experiment demonstrates that we mimic the mannerisms and behaviours of people we are with and, most importantly, we do this unconsciously. This is evidence of an innate mimetic faculty. The Mimetic Faculty and Learning Learning is essential to get thinkers to the position where they are capable of ideation either in the C Class or at the frontiers of the A Class. Clearly, specialization is required for both classes. If I am to imitate—and this could mean copy exactly or approximately—I need to be able to see or discover the essence of what I am to imitate. For example, a child will see other children kicking a ball and then he or she will try it. If a calculus student wants to understand what the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus means, he or she will look at some examples to see how it works. A lawyer’s work in the common law requires assessing how the facts of the case are the same as precedent cases. Hence our mimetic faculty is critical to cultural learning. When we were in the early grades of primary school, we had to practice printing. For example, the teacher explained to us that the letter “a” was a circle with a vertical stick to the right; she’d then give us specially lined sheets where at the start of the line, there was the letter drawn perfectly, and we would then complete the line by copying the letter repeadedly. The mimetic faculty is crucial to learning in school from start to finish. Even when we finish our formal education, learning continues because if we’re mining a vein of the A Class, we need to understand the most recent ideas. In all societies, whether advanced or not, there must be a transmission of the society’s culture from one generation to the next. Hence there must be learning and this depends cru- cially on our mimetic faculty. The Mimetic Faculty and Ideation We’ve seen that a critical aspect of our ability to mine the A Class is to be able to recognize abstract patterns and our mimetic faculty has to be a part of this. We need to be able to explain the world and finding these “invisible samenesses” requires a mimetic faculty. 7.6 Cooperation and Game Theory Harari Yuval Harari’s Sapiens is an interesting book about our natural history.28 He offers two rea- sons for why we’re so different from other species. The first is our ability to cooperate flexibly 28 Yuval Harari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (New York: Harper, 2015). 154 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation on a large scale. He observes that the social insects (bees, ants, etc.) cooperate but not flexibly. There is no way to change how they do business over a short period of time. In contrast, Karl Marx (1818–1883 CE) set significant social forces in play just with words on a page. The second reason is our imaginations, our willingness to entertain a dual reality, one that is real and the other, fictional. We believe in things like God, nation-states, corpora- tions, and money but these are not real like bananas, hockey sticks, and the sun. Money is particularly fascinating. I can go to a restaurant with my family and we can eat like royalty. In return, I can give the owner a little piece of paper and he’ll be happy. We’re all happy even though I’ve feasted and the owner just gets a little piece of paper. In contrast, chimpanzees don’t do fiction. If you want a chimpanzee’s coconut, it will require peanuts or bananas or some other concrete thing it values. The Prisoner’s Dilemma and Its Variations In many situations, individuals (or governments or other kinds of organizations) are faced with a choice between competing or cooperating. Darwin saw competition as the natural state among species. He characterized it as “survival of the fittest,” and this is echoed in Ten- nyson’s line “Tho’ nature, red in tooth and claw.”29 Within some species, particularly ours, there has been extensive cooperation although, at times, there is competition. In this section, I consider what game theory has to say about this trade-off and about the evolutionary pros- pects for cooperation. Consider the Prisoner’s Dilemma. This is a game played between two opponents with this payoff matrix: Player 1 Cooperate(C) Defect(D) Cooperate(C) (3,3) (5,0) Defect(D) (0,5) (1,1) Player 2 Each player has two strategies: Cooperate(C) and Defect(D). The ordered pair (x,y) in the matrix represents the payoffs to the players: the first element, x, is the payoff to Player 1; the second, y, is the payoff to Player 2. For example, when Player 1 plays D and Player 2 C, the payoff to Player 1 is 5 and to Player 2 is 0. The rules of the game are simple. Each player chooses a strategy independently and each then receives the corresponding payoff. Each player would like to receive the highest possible payoff. This game is termed the Prisoner’s Dilemma and it’s been studied for a long time. 29 From “In Memoriam, A. H. H.,” Canto 56. Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 155 Let’s consider how the players ought to play. Consider Player 1. If Player 2 plays C, Player 1’s best strategy is D; and if Player 2 plays D, Player 1’s best strategy is also D. Therefore, Player 1’s best strategy is to choose D because, with it, he gets the highest possible payoff. It’s a best response regardless of what Player 2 chooses. Of course, we can make the same argument for Player 2. His best strategy choice is also D. We’ll call (D,D) the Competitive outcome. Note that both players are better off if they choose C and I’ll call this the Cooperative outcome. The difficulty with the Cooperative outcome is that there is an incentive for a player to defect from this outcome because, if one player plays C, the other is best to play D. Remember that neither player knows what the other had chosen. A more interesting game is an Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) where two contes- tants play the single-play Prisoner’s Dilemma a large number of times. There is no best strategy for this game under reasonable parameter restrictions. Robert Axelrod ran a com- petition among game theorists to see who could come up with the best strategy for an IPD game.30 Each participant submitted a computer program implementing his or her strategy and these strategies were played against each other in a round-robin tournament. For each two submissions, 200 iterations of the IPD game were played. The winner of the tourna- ment—Anatol Rapoport, an eminent game theorist—used a Tit-for-Tat strategy. This strat- egy plays Cooperate on the first play and, thereafter, the strategy the opponent played on the previous iteration. This is an interesting strategy. It punishes an opponent’s defection but allows a return to cooperation if the opponent is prepared to begin cooperating again. If Tit-for-Tat is played against itself, each player will get the cooperative outcome for each iteration. The other interesting part of Axelrod’s book is his discussion of real-world situations where it’s surprising that cooperation would emerge. One was trench warfare in World War I, a war of astonishing carnage and hostility. As documented by Tony Ashworth, it turns out that, over large sections of the front, an implicit non-violent cooperation developed over sig- nificant periods of time.31 Ashworth based his findings on the memoirs, diaries, letters, etc. of soldiers and officers. Some of these participants characterized these informal cease-fires as a “Live and Let Live” phenomenon. Additionally, when these “truces” were broken, the side breaking it was subjected to the maximum level of hostility by the other. Most famously, there was the Christmas Truce of 1914. Around Ypres, an informal cease-fire developed over Christmas Eve and through Christmas day. Before it began, soldiers on both sides were singing Christmas hymns, posting Merry Christmas signs, and putting candles in trees. On Christmas day, there were meetings in No Man’s Land where there were exchanges of gifts and even a soccer game. It’s remarkable that such cooperation could emerge in such a hostile environment. 30 Robert Axelrod, The Evolution of Cooperation (New York: Basic Books, 1984). 31 Tony Ashworth, “The Sociology of Trench Warfare 1914–18,” The British Journal of Sociology 19, no. 4 (1968). 156 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation Martin Nowak, with co-authors, has extended Axelrod’s work. In Axelrod’s tournament, the model is of two players playing an IPD game. But in real life, there are many examples of altruism where the giver and receiver engage only once and there are many examples of charitable giving where the donor doesn’t know the receiver. Our models need to explain these one-time occurrences of anonymous altruism. To deal with altruism, Nowak incorporates five constructs of cooperation.32 For example, one is indirect reciprocity. It’s basically a reputation effect where an agent assumes that if he or she scratches another’s back, his or her back will be scratched by someone else. One aspect of Nowak’s contribution has been the development of strategy alternatives to Tit-for-Tat for an IPD game.33 One is Generous Tit-for-Tat which cooperates after a competitor’s C and coop- erates with probability p after a competitor’s D. Another is Pavlov which requires a player to play C if and only if both players played the same strategy (either D or C) in the previous iteration. Both of these strategies outperform Tit-for-Tat under a wide range of parameter assumptions. They both have a much better forgiveness feature than Tit-for-Tat and hence there are fewer and shorter periods of defection. Finally, evolutionary biologists have been looking for a supplement to mutation and natu- ral selection to explain our behaviour. In their book, SuperCooperators: Altruism, Evolu- tion, and Why We Need Each Other to Succeed, Martin Nowak and Roger Highfield have proposed that we consider cooperation as one of the forces of evolution.34 7.7 Ultrasociality and A Class Ideation Ultrasociality refers to our ability to live in very large groups of genetically unrelated indi- viduals, a behavioural characteristic that only humans seem to have. Imagine what would happen if we filled a jumbo jet with 500 chimpanzees and sent them on an unsupervised ten-hour flight? Primatologists tell us that it wouldn’t be pretty. One of the great unanswered questions in social science is how we’ve managed to do this. We are primates with a deep wiring for traditional primate behaviours. We know that primates live in territorial kin-based groups and that they will defend aggressively any territorial transgression by unrelated conspecifics. So we’re not really surprised when we see such behaviour by humans. Modern urban gangs are an example. If one gang invades another’s territory or resources, then there is usually violence to resolve the transgression. Nation states are capable of severe violence in the face of aggression: it’s been estimated that 70–85 million people perished in World War II. 32 Martin Nowak, “Five Rules for the Evolution of Cooperation,” Science 314, no. 5805 (2006). 33 Martin Nowak and Karl Sigmund, “A Strategy of Win-Stay, Lose-Shift That Outperforms Tit-for-Tat in the Prisoner’s Dilemma Game,” Nature 364, no. 6432 (1993). 34 Martin Nowak with Roger Highfield, SuperCooperators: Altruism, Evolution, and Why We Need Each Other to Succeed (New York: Free Press, 2011). Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation 157 At the other extreme, humans are capable of significant acts of altruism. In World War II, many soldiers volunteered and lost their lives in the fight. There are many exam- ples of charitable giving and volunteering. We give blood and some give organs to non-kin. Many modern governments have social programs designed to bring up standards of living to an acceptable minimum. Even Darwin noted that altruistic behaviour is a conundrum for evolution and natural selection. What would possess a person to help another at great personal expense? One of the great questions is how we evolved this ability to cooperate in such large non- genetically related groups so quickly? After all, it was only 12,000 years ago that we lived in small kin-based hunter-gatherer groups. Certainly, our recent prosocial activities run counter to the kin-based wiring developed over millions of years. Surprisingly, we’ve done it. Importantly, what comes with it is a considerable expansion of the Ideasphere and particularly the A Class. The International Space Station is a marvel of modern technology built by a consortium of countries at a cost of $150 billion. That’s a long way from a small group of hunter-gatherers working for an afternoon to secure dinner. It’s easy to come up with literally thousands of such mega-project examples where our ultrasoci- ality has expanded the A Class. Ultimately, we’ve set up cultural forms that enable us to contribute to the A Class on a grand scale. Effectively, these forms allow us to exploit a global network of imaginations. When it comes to the A Class, McLuhan’s global village has arrived. Unfortunately, our advance has not been without problems and I’ll take this up in a sub- sequent chapter. 7.8 Taking Stock: The Great Duality When we think of our inventiveness, we tend to focus on the solitary mind, the genius at work, painstakingly moving towards a great idea. The names Aristotle, Shakespeare, Newton, Einstein, and Darwin come to mind. In Shakespeare’s words, what a piece of work is man! But the individual is only a small part of the story. First, the individual imagination and the knowledge that imagination works upon are socially manufactured. Charles Darwin didn’t come out of the womb ready to write down the theory of evolution by natural selection. His education at the University of Edinburgh and Cambridge is well documented as was his self-study of natural history. Darwin’s was very much a socially constructed mind. Second, over our evolutionary history, we’ve developed some remarkable cognitive skills which allow us to share our ideas. One is language. The other is exographics. As I have already explained, exographics enables us to think about imaginary worlds, worlds like the corpus of mathematics. We appear to be the only species capable of accessing these abstract worlds (the A Class) and it’s been most beneficial to us. 158 Chapter 7 Networked Imaginations and Ideation Finally, once we have a good idea, we communicate it, and this draws others into the effort to enhance the idea. The Ideasphere is the object of a lot of ongoing joint activity, par- ticularly at the frontiers of the A Class. What makes all of this possible is our intense desire to collaborate. While individuals have ideas, it’s the cooperation of individuals over time that has brought the Ideasphere to its current state. That’s the paradox. In the end, we have a network of minds, fuelled by indi- vidual imagination. It’s this Great Duality that drives the expansion of the Ideasphere.","length":58774,"tokens":13590,"chunks":[{"title":"Networked Imaginations and Ideation","content":"Because if that’s your desire, I’d like to weld you together and join you into some- thing that is naturally whole, so that the two of you are made into one.

As a species, we pay attention and if some of us can improve some aspect of culture with a good idea then we “suggest” it and maybe our improvement gets adopted. For example, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot (1725–1804 CE) built a steam-powered tractor for the French Army in 1769. Since that time, we’ve improved vehicles continuously with a host of minor changes and some major changes. In addition to the vehicles themselves, we have a large support system includ- ing gas stations, repair shops, massive road systems, government organizations for licensing and safety, and the legal system to adjudicate how to sort out fault in accidents among other things.

Charles Bazerman offers a nice summary of it: Hutchins makes this argument explicitly only in the short closing chapter “Cultural Cognition.” Until that point Hutchins has painstakingly constructed a 350 page description of an actually occurring situated intelligent activity, carried out collaboratively in a concrete material setting by socially related individuals working within a structured organization, embedded within an elaborate culture and employing historically developed cultural tools, both material and symbolic.

In this case, there would be three logarithmic scales and if you knew 2 values (in this case distance and time), you would use a straight edge to connect those two, and then the straight edge would give you the speed on the third axis. In each of these approaches, you are doing a fundamentally different calculation. Clearly your cognition to get the speed is situationally and culturally determined.

The child sees this, immediately let’s go of his mother’s hand, walks to the bookcase, and opens the doors.

He observes what the experimenter does and infers that the experimenter’s goal is to move the magazines to the bookcase. On the experimenter’s second pass, the boy watches the experi- menter and correctly concludes that not only does the experimenter want to open the doors of the bookcase, but also that he can’t do it because both his hands are tied up holding the books.

The key to appreciating the behaviour of the little boy is to understand what would hap- pen if a chimpanzee were placed in the same situation. Given what I know, a chimpanzee wouldn’t be the least bit interested in helping.

Michael Tomasello has referred to this ability in the little boy as shared intentionality.8 It comprises two components. First, it’s a suite of skills that enable the boy to understand the intentions of others and second, it includes the boy’s intrinsic motivation to help, to cooper- ate, and to collaborate.

As described in the previous sec- tion, even very young children exhibit this skill, a skill referred to as theory of mind (ToM) in the psychology literature. To me, the term really doesn’t capture what is going on. Let me try to clarify. We all experience thoughts, beliefs, desires, feelings, etc. and these are our own.

In Poetics, Aristotle argues that it’s instinctual. He also felt that our reasoning ability derived from our ability to see an object as the imitation of another (as in analogical reasoning) The German philosopher, Walter Benjamin (1892–1940 CE), wrote this: Nature produces similarities; one need only think of mimicry.

There is perhaps not a single one of his higher functions in which his mimetic faculty does not play a decisive role.14 Subsequently he argued that the mimetic faculty is the ability to produce and recognize similarities or sameness. In his book, Mimesis and Alterity, the anthropologist, Michael Taussig, expands on Benjamin’s definition:    the faculty to copy, imitate, make models, explore difference, yield into and become Other. The wonder of mimesis lies in the copy drawing on the character of the original, to the point whereby the representation may even assume that character and that power.15 13 Heider and Simmel, “An Experimental Study,” 246–247.","content_length":794,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Networked Imaginations and Ideation","content":"14 Walter Benjamin, “On the Mimetic Faculty,” in Selected Writings, 1926–1934, translated by Rodney Livingstone and others, edited by Michael W.

As these scholars have suggested, our mimetic faculty includes not only our ability to imitate but also the cognitive ability to see the similarity or sameness in a collection of objects. A good example of this is the assessment of relational match-to-sample problems, a concept we’ve already looked at.","content_length":757,"content_tokens":177,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Networked Imaginations and Ideation","content":"Recall that, if the sample is “AA” and the objects are “BB” and “CD,” then “AA” is judged to be the most similar to “BB” This is a significant human cognitive skill: we’re able to see the sameness in collections of objects which are, on their face, different. Mimesis The ancient Greeks thought of mimesis as the imitation or representation of reality, usually in the context of literature and art. The idea dates at least to the Homeric Hymns (approximately 700 BCE) Gregory Nagy suggests that in the Hymn to Apollo, the Delian Maidens engage in mimesis.16 Both Plato (in Republic) and Aristotle (in Poetics) argue that the artist (in sculpture, wall paintings, mosaics, etc.) and poet (in drama) attempt to represent real-world phenomena.","content_length":740,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Networked Imaginations and Ideation","content":"The Greek “Kouroi” statues of beardless, muscular youth are examples.

So, while mimesis means to imitate, it does not generally mean to produce an exact copy. Mime is a form of theater where the story is acted out with body gesture and facial expression without language. It dates to ancient Greece. Silent films of the early 20th century are good examples.

It would be impossible for a single one of us to build a rocket to get us to the moon. One of our skills that enable this collaboration is speech, this ability we have to use sound to share the contents of our minds. The sound comes out as a sequence of phonemes, fun- damental units of sound which, individually are meaningless, but taken in sequence, mean something. Other species communicate but not nearly as richly, finely, and accurately as we do. Parrots are able to reproduce human speech but don’t seem to understand the meaning of what they say. Chimpanzees, our close evolutionary relatives, don’t speak but they do com- municate with gesture. Vervet monkeys appear to have a rudimentary language: lookouts in the trees communicate to those on the ground not only that there is a predator lurking but also the kind of predator. The contrast with human language is stark: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.1 Given the degree to which we have cooperated for as long as we have, I don’t think it’s sur- prising that we communicate with such precision and depth. In fact, if we were not capable of making speech sounds, it’s my guess that we would “speak” a very sophisticated sign language. The desire and necessity to cooperate drives the need to communicate. The two are symbiotic. 1 This is the first sentence of the US Declaration of Independance, largely written by Thomas Jefferson with, as some have argued, divine inspiration. 159 160 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation The psychologist Merlin Donald has written extensively on the evolution of language.2 He opens his paper “Imitation and Mimesis” with this idea: The output of any nervous system is muscle movement. Therefore, the only way a nervous system can publicly display and transmit its perceptions of the world to another nervous system is to translate its perceptions into patterns of muscle movements. A mimetic act is basically a motor performance that reflects the perceived structure of the world, and its motoric aspect makes its content a public, that is, a potentially cultural, expression.3 At some point, our ancestors began to communicate in very novel ways. If we go far enough back, there were three ways they could have communicated: gesture-only, voice- only, and some combination of the two. Gesture-only communication is effectively sign language which, today, is known to be as rich and expressive as speech. Each of these modes requires the brain to send signals along the motor neural system to the muscles it wants moved. The mode we currently use for speaking—voice and gesture—requires the brain to operate our hands, arms, and voice box. As we’ll see, most of us have difficulty producing speech if we are not able to gesture. This suggests that gesture might have deep origins. Imagine one of our ancient ancestors getting back to camp after hunting and explaining that one in the hunting party had been attacked by the prey. He might hold up the index finger on his left hand and then, with his right hand, sweep in and grab the extended index finger. That gesture is effectively a sentence: there is a subject (the left- hand index finger), and a verb (the right-hand sweeping across and grabbing the index finger). At least initially, gesture would be much more efficient than speech. Moreover, the archaeological evidence on the various stone tool industries suggests that we’ve been working with our hands for millions of years. Based on this long experience manipulating objects I have to think that our hands were a big part of the story of the origins of spoken language. Speech does have some evolutionary advantages: with speech, our hands are free for other activities and we can communicate when it’s dark. Now flash forward to the point in our recent history when we invented writing. This gave us another mode of communication. It’s also symbolic representation and it has the characteristic that it’s in our visual field much like signing with our hands is in our visual field. Importantly, writing is persistent whereas signing, like spoken language, is not. 2 See, for example: Merlin Donald, Origins of the Modern Mind: Three Stages in the Evolution of Culture and Cognition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991). 3 Merlin Donald, “Imitation and Mimesis,” in Perspectives on Imitation: From Neuroscience to Social Science, Volume 2: Imitation, Human Development, and Culture, eds. Susan Hurley and Nick Chater (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005): 283. Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 161 8.1 Embodied Communication Gesture Gesture is ubiquitous. All human cultures have a language and gesture is integral to every one of them. Congenitally blind people make significant use of gesture when they speak to each other on the telephone. Why? Could it be that gesture is an integral component of the production of speech? The literature on the role of gesture in language is large. There are many papers and some excellent books including those by Susan Goldin-Meadow, Adam Kendon, and David McNeill.4 There is experimental evidence that speakers use more gesture when they know a listener can see their gestures. For example, Akiba Cohen and Randall Harrison used the following methodology.5 The basic scenario was an executive explaining to a secretary the directions to different locations of interest. In one condition, the secretary asked for directions in person and in the other, by intercom. The executives used an average of 9 gestures per minute in the in-person condition and 5 per minute for the intercom condition. A number of follow-on studies by different researchers replicated this result using similar methodologies. One objection is that a speaker may change the content of what he or she says depending on whether the listener can see the speaker’s gestures. But Martha Alibali et al. studied the content of speech in the can-see and can’t-see conditions and found no evidence of change in the content of the speech.6 These two studies suggest that gesture adds something to speech. Another possibility is that gesture helps the speaker. David McNeill reports the results of an experiment where speakers were subjected to an audio delay of their speech.7 It’s well known that the production of speech requires speakers to be able to hear what they’re say- ing. There has to be just about immediate audio feedback for the speaker to produce normal speech. In the experiment, McNeill had his speakers recount the contents of a cartoon. For the first half of this exercise, the speaker heard his/her voice without delay. But for the second half, the speaker wore headphones where his/her speech was delayed by 0.2 seconds. This delay condition had a significant effect: All speakers used more gesture in the delay condition. In fact, one speaker, who didn’t use any gesture in the normal condition, used a substantial number of gestures in the delay condition. 4 Susan Goldin-Meadow, Hearing Gesture: How Our Hands Help Us Think (Cambridge: Belknap Press, 2003); Adam Kendon, Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004); and David McNeill, Hand and Mind: What Gestures Reveal About Thought (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). 5 Akiba Cohen and Randall Harrison, “Intentionality in the Use of Hand Illustrators in Face-to-face Communication Situations,” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 28, no. 2 (1973). 6 Martha Alibalia, Dana Heath, and Heather Myers, “Effects of Visibility Between Speaker and Listener on Gesture Production: Some Gestures Are Meant to be Seen,” Journal of Memory and Language 44, no. 2 (2001). 7 McNeill, Hand and Mind, 1992. 162 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation Luis Marcos considered the use of gesture by bilinguals who spoke one of their languages better than the other.8 Let’s refer to the person’s good language as the dominant language and the other as the nondominant. The subjects were asked to speak about either love or friendship in their nondominant language. Marcos found that speakers less proficient in their nondominant language used more gesture. Both the McNeill and Marcos experiments suggest that speakers placed in situations where the speech cognition task is more difficult resort to more gesture indicating that ges- ture is important to the production of speech. Finally, we’ll consider an interesting experiment by Susan Goldin-Meadow et al.9 They had both children and adults solve math problems at a blackboard individually. Children solved equations like this: 3 + 6 + 5 = x + 6; adults solved factoring problems: x2 − 7x + 10 = ( )( ). After getting a solution, children were given a list of words to remember and adults were given a list of letters to remember (letters are harder to remember than words). Then both groups were asked to stand at the board and explain how they got their answers. Once these explanations were provided, they were asked to reproduce what they had been assigned to remember. The experimenters looked at two conditions. In one, subjects were allowed the use of gesture in their solution explanations (the gesture condition); in the other, they were not (the no-gesture condition). Think about this experiment from the point of view of the subjects. It’s one thing to explain how you solved a math problem. It’s much more difficult to do this when you also have to keep either a word or letter list in your working memory. The experimenters expected to see that subjects in the gesture condition could remember more words and letters and this is what they found. Gesture appears to lighten the cognitive load, thus allowing subjects to remember more words and letters. All of this experimental evidence suggests that gesture is important in the production of language. In addition, given that most of us do not consciously gesture, it’s likely that the symbiotic nature of gesture and language have ancient roots. Eye Movement Saccadic eye movements are abrupt, rapid changes in pupil position. Our vision is most accu- rate along the foveal line, essentially where our eyes are focussed. To see this, pick any line on this page and fix your focus on the first word of that line. Now try to read the line while maintaining a fixed focus on the first word.

For some time, researchers have noted that elevated saccade rates are associated with thinking. This is illustrated in the experimental work of Howard Ehrlichman and John 8 Luis Marcos, “Hand Movements and Nondominant Fluency in Bilinguals,” Perceptual and Motor Skills 48, no. 1 (1979). 9 Susan Goldin-Meadow, Howard Nusbaum, Spencer Kelly and Susan Wagner, “Explaining Math: Gesturing Lightens the Load,” Psychological Science 12, no. 6 (2001). Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 163 Barrett.10 They had subjects do cognitive exercises in both the light and complete darkness. There was no significant reduction in the eye-movement rate (EMR, measured in saccades per second) in darkness. This saccadic movement associated with thinking is termed nonvi- sual eye movement. Eye-movement rates vary depending on the type of cognitive exercise. Visio-spatial exercises tend to reduce EMR. For example, suppose you were asked to specify the number of edges on a cube. Most of us tend to cast our gaze away and our EMR tends to be reduced. Effectively, we stare into space to answer this type of question. Alternately, suppose you were asked a verbal question, something like “Name a six-letter word with 3 consonants and 3 vowels.” In this case, the EMR is significantly higher than for the visio- spatial exercise. Ehrlichman and Dragano Micic suggest that questions which require a search of long- term memory (finding a six-letter word with 3 consonants and 3 vowels) result in a signifi- cantly higher EMR than the case where a problem can be solved in working memory (the number of edges a cube has) and their experimental results support this finding.11 The obvious question is what explains this difference. Such explanations become more fascinating when you consider the results of Dragano Micic et al.12 They had their experi- mental subjects do a word list recall exercise under two experimental conditions. In the first, subjects were told to fix their gaze at a dot in front of them (fixed gaze); in the second, there were no restrictions on eye movement (free gaze). Surprisingly, there was no difference in performance. Those subjects in the fixed gaze condition were able to recall just as many words as those in the free gaze condition. Of note, 18 of the 75 subjects in the fixed gaze condition found it impossible to eliminate eye movement. To summarize, we have yet to identify exactly why people move their eyes when they think. But they do move and this is another example of embodied cognition. Blinking, Attention, and Thought The general explanation for blinking is that it serves to lubricate our eyes. But research sug- gests we blink more than what this purpose calls for. One of the reasons is that it appears to play a significant role in our cognitive processes. Studies suggest that our blink rate falls as cognitive load increases. For example, Kenneth Wong et al. report that a surgeon will blink a lot less in the operating room.13 Presumably this is because his or her cognitive load is con- siderably higher than it would be, say, in a normal conversation. 10 Howard Ehrlichman and John Barrett, “‘Random’ Saccadic Eye Movements During Verbal-Linguistic and Visual-Imagi- nal Tasks,” Acta Psychologica 53, no. 1 (1983). 11 Howard Ehrlichman and Dragano Micic, “Why Do People Move Their Eyes When They Think?” Current Directions in Psychological Science 21, no. 2 (2012). 12 Dragana Micic, Howard Ehrlichman, and Rebecca Chen, “Why Do We Move Our Eyes While Trying to Remember? The Relationship Between Non-Visual Gaze Patterns and Memory,” Brain and Cognition 74, no. 3 (2010). 13 Kenneth Wong, Wei Wan, and Stephen Kaye, “Blinking and Operating: Cognition versus Vision,” The British Journal of Ophthalmology 86, no. 4 (2002). 164 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation Tamami Nakano et al. placed their experimental subjects in an fMRI scanner and had them watching a TV show.14 They were able to observe the areas of the brain engaged and a subject’s blinking. There was a significant increase in the number of blinks when a subject’s neural activity indicated that he or she was moving from the perceptual activity of watching the show to an introspective activity. This evidence suggests that blinking has a role to play in the brain’s switch from perceptual effort to introspective/imaginative effort. I watch CNN a lot more than I should. Very often they show a conversation between an anchor and an expert in split screen. The anchor asks a question and then the expert responds. It’s hard not to notice the change in facial movements when either of these goes from listen- ing to speaking. When either speaks, the speaker’s facial movement increases considerably and, more particularly, he or she will blink a lot more. One would think that this blinking has something to do with cognitive processes of thought and speech production just like gesture and saccadic eye movement help but I’ve not been able to find any research on this issue. 8.2 Speech There is an ongoing debate on the origins of language. If we go back 6 million years when we were an arboreal small-headed ape, it’s unlikely we spoke. Something must have hap- pened in the interim. The linguist, Noam Chomsky, has argued that language was the result of an evolutionary adaptation that hard-wired an internal “universal grammar” some time ago. Indeed, the casual evidence seems to point in this direction. Children learn their native tongue effortlessly at a very early age with virtually no instruction. This includes an exten- sive vocabulary and an understanding of syntax. A little boy might say to his mother “Mom, you sit next to me” but would never say “Mom, next to me sit.” It’s also surprising how quickly children learn irregular verbs. A child might say “I goed to the store” thinking that the general rule for forming the past tense of a verb is to add an “ed” to the base verb, in this case “go.” He or she infers this rule after hearing a number of sentences like “I played in the park last Saturday” or “Mom baked a cake yesterday.” He or she would eventually notice or be told that some verbs are different, and would figure out that the correct syntax for the original sentence is “I went to the store.” A child does not have to sit at a desk and be taught the past tense of all of the irregular verbs. He or she learns these with little help and effort. Chomsky calls this phenomenon the poverty of the input to recognize that children learn the rules of language with very little experience. This is his main argument for the existence of an innate scaffolding for language. An implication is that if a very young child born to Chinese- speaking parents were adopted by an English couple, the child would learn to speak English as a matter of course. In contrast to the ease with which we pick up language, we really struggle with other cultural skills like reading, writing, and simple arithmetic. 14 Tamami Nakano, Makoto Kato, Yusuke Morito, Seishi Itoi, and Shigeru Kitazawa, “Blink-related Momentary Activation of the Default Mode Network While Viewing Videos,” PNAS 110, no. 2 (2013). Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 165 Chomsky’s position on the innateness of language is beginning to be challenged. Two noteworthy contributions are those of Daniel Everett and Cecilia Heyes who both argue the cultural origins of language.15 The Physiology of Language To make speech sounds, we draw air into our lungs, push it out through our vocal cords, and then the pharynx and mouth. Essentially the base sound is manufactured as the air passes the vocal cords. Subsequently this sound is modulated (changed) by the way we move and place our tongue, teeth, and lips. To see this, let’s contrast what happens when you make the sounds “pea” and “poo.” They both begin the same way: you close your mouth and build air pressure against it. To make the “pea” sound, my lips seem to move inward as I open my mouth; but to make the “poo” sound, they move out. Now consider what happens when you make the “d” (“dee”) sound. Your tongue attaches to the top of your open mouth, air pressure is built up, and the tongue is moved to release the air and generate the sound. Nobody has to teach us how to make these sounds. We learn them early on with little effort. Our speech musculature is complex. But its control is the really interesting aspect. Your brain has to control all of the fine motor movements required in the vocal tract in addition to deciding what to say. As we all know, this muscle control is done effortlessly. We don’t have to think about it because it’s all done subconsciously. In fact, we don’t think much about the fine detail of what we want to say. When we speak contemporaneously, we generate a rough idea of what we want to say and then it comes out with only the briefest of previews. As it turns out, our hearing is important in the delivery of speech. The evidence for this is the effect on speech that young children experience subsequent to losing their hearing. Produc- ing good speech requires auditory feedback. There has been an ongoing debate on why nonhuman primates don’t speak. One side takes the position that they do not have the vocal tract to replicate human speech (the so- called “peripheral hypothesis”); the other believes they don’t have the required neural capa- bility (the “neural hypothesis”). Based on a sophisticated simulation, Tecumseh Fitch et al. have recently argued that monkey vocal tracts are capable of speech and, with their model, demonstrate that a monkey could say “Will you marry me?”16 Their conclusion is that nonhu- man primates can speak but don’t yet have the neural wiring for it. In a comment published in the same journal, Philip Leiberman questions the result.17 He argues that nonhuman primates cannot produce the quantal vowels (the vowels in the words “see,” “do,” and “ma”), a result 15 Daniel Everett, How Language Began: The Story of Humanity’s Greatest Invention (London: Profile Books, 2017); and Cecilia Heyes, Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2018). 16 Tecumseh Fitch, Bart de Boer, Neil Mathur, and Asif Ghazanfar, “Monkey Vocal Tracts are Speech-ready,” Science Advances 2, no. 12 (2016). 17 Philip Lieberman, Philip, “Comment on: Monkey Vocal Tracts are Speech-ready,” Science Advances 3, no. 7 (2016). 166 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation that Fitch et al. would concede. These quantal vowels are common to just about all human languages and would be necessary if the full range and sophistication of human speech were to be reproduced. The debate is far from settled. Regardless of the actual reason, it serves to emphasize that a lot has to go right for a species to speak as we do. Speech and Meaning Language is made up of fundamental sounds called phonemes. For example, the word “team” comprises the sounds “t,” “E” (the long “e,” pronounced as the “ee” in “teeth”), and “m.” Each of these is meaningless. Yet when they’re said in the particular sequence—t-E-m—they constitute a word (morpheme) with a meaning we all know. Linguists term this fact that you can get something meaningful from meaningless parts the dual patterning of language. There is a further combinatorial aspect of language. We use words to form sentences. These sentences are constructed according to rules which linguists refer to as syntax. The number of sentences each of us can form is limitless. For some of these, it might be the first time they’ve ever been uttered by any human being. Hence, with just 42 phonemes, we can produce an unlimited number of sound sequences, each with an associated meaning. One of the more remarkable things about speech is our ability to translate sound to meaning. Here we’ll just look at the basics. The normal rate for the speed of speech delivery is about 12 phonemes per second. The sentence “In hell, I’ll be in good company” totals 21 phonemes which means, at a speed of 12 phonemes per second, it could be said in under 2 seconds. This sentence is easy to understand when someone speaks it at this normal rate. It turns out that we can understand speech delivered at 5 times this rate with a bit of practise. This is surprising when you consider that a discrete “beep” played at 20 times per second (or higher) sounds like an uninterrupted sound.18 Unfortunately, our ability to recall auditory input is limited. For instance, imagine listen- ing to this sequence of letters “g,s,r,a,e,e,e,d,n,i” and then having to repeat it once the list was finished. This is difficult because we just can’t put this input to memory fast enough. If we try hard to remember it as it comes out, we miss some of the later input. Equivalently, new input wipes out our short-term memory of old input before we’ve had a chance to store it. Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater term this the now or never bottleneck and it’s certainly an appropriate name for the phenomenon.19 The problem of speech is one of understanding what a sequence of words means. There have been a number of models of how the mind actually ascribes a meaning to language. One that makes a lot of sense to me is embodied simulation. The idea is that when we hear a sentence, we actually attempt a simulation in our minds of what is suggested in the sentence. 18 Michael Eysenck, Psychology: An International Perspective (New York: Psychology Press (Taylor and Francis Group), 2004). 19 Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater, “The Now-or-Never Bottleneck: A Fundamental Constraint on Language,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 39, no. e62 (2016). Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 167 Let’s try an experiment. Here is the first paragraph of Joseph Boyden’s The Orenda: I awake. A few minutes, maybe, of troubled sleep. My teeth chatter so violently I can taste I’ve bitten my swollen tongue. Spitting red into the snow, I try to rise but my body’s seized. The oldest Huron, their leader, who kept us walking all night around the big lake rather than across it because of some ridiculous dream, stands above me with a thorn club. The weight these men give their dreams will be the end of them.20 Now try to answer these questions: Did you picture in your mind a specific character for the person narrating the story? If so, describe that character. In your mind’s eye, did you have an image of the Huron leader? If so, does your vision allow you to describe the colour and length of his hair? For the first, I actually pictured Boyden himself prostate on the snow with a bloodied mouth. So my character was male. For the second, my image of the Huron leader was an older man with indigenous facial features and long grey hair. It was a dirty grey, not yet white. As it turns out, all of us tend to build a simulation of this action in our minds. We see char- acters in a specific setting and we’re able to describe the vision in detail and in fact more detail than what the paragraph actually provides. For example, I asked five of my students to answer these questions and each had the narrator male even though the paragraph makes no mention of the narrator’s sex. Each was also able to describe the Huron elder’s hair even though there is no mention of it in the paragraph. The interested reader is referred to Benjamin Bergen’s book, Louder Than Words, for an excellent introduction to embodied simulation.21 There are some other tricks we employ to ascribe a meaning to the whole. First, we don’t put to memory all of the words we hear. Instead, we store a meaning that we call the gist, an effect that psychologists call the verbatim effect. For instance, if someone tells you the story The Three Little Pigs, you can retell the story but not with the same words the teller uses. You’re able to keep track of the main ideas in the story and your mind fills in the rest as you reconstruct it. The second trick is anticipation. Imagine someone said to you a sentence with six words and the first five are “How do ya like them ..” Another word is coming and you expect that it’s “apples.” As someone speaks, your mind is automatically forming expectations of the next word. Here’s another interesting aspect of speech interpretation. Most people believe we per- ceive speech only with our ears. That’s not true. It turns out that we also “see” speech. 20 Joseph Boyden, The Orenda (London: Oneworld Publications, 2013), 5. 21 Benjamin Bergen, Louder Than Words: The New Science of How the Mind Makes Meaning (New York: Basic Books, 2012). 168 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation My best friend’s father is an example. Mr. Lynch was hearing impaired from a very early age. He was sent to a special school where he was taught to read lips among other things. Later in life, when he would watch televised hockey games with his adult sons, sometimes a player given a penalty would really jaw at the referee. Canadian players are especially profane when they voice their opinion on a referee’s call. In some cases, if there was a close-up of the player yelling at the referee, Mr. Lynch would start laughing, turn to his boys and say “Did you hear that?!” That we use more than one sense to assign a message to language is most easily under- stood with the McGurk Effect. To see videos demonstrating it, just search YouTube. One I like begins with viewers looking directly at a man’s face as he says “da, da, da, da.” Subse- quently, we’re asked to turn our face away and just listen to the sound of the video. In this case, you hear the man saying “ba, ba, ba, ba.” Finally, we’re asked to look at the man again only this time the sound is turned off and we only see his lips move. They appear to be say- ing “ga, ga, ga, ga”! So, clearly, the first frames of the video were doctored. The man was saying “ba, ba, ba, ba” but his lips are moving as if he was saying “ga, ga, ga, ga.” With this, we end up reporting something we didn’t see or hear! Effectively, we perceive an amalgam of what we heard and saw. This is clear evidence that we perceive speech with our ears and eyes. Let’s now have a look at the fascinating gymnastics our minds do to extract meaning. We’re very good at filling in details not explicitly covered by the speaker. A good example of this skill can be found in the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a test of Artificial Intel- ligence (AI) proposed by Hector Levesque (University of Toronto). The WSC is a successor to the Turing Test, the original test of AI proposed by Alan Turing (1912–1954 CE) in 1950. It’s based on a specific set of questions that Terry Winograd, a Stanford computer science, suggested to test AI. For example, suppose we gave a machine these two sentences: The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence. The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence. The problem is to identify who the italicized “they” refers to in each sentence. It’s either the city councilmen or the demonstrators. In order to determine which, a machine would have to know what the verbs “advocate” and “fear” mean. Humans do this problem easily: given what we know about city councils, demonstrators, and the verbs, we’d quickly determine that the “they” in the first sentence referred to the demonstrators. Where we do have trouble interpreting speech is when we have to interpret sentences like this: “At that time, John was aware that Mary believed that Phil understood John knew that Harry had two girlfriends.” This is difficult to sort out for most of us. You have to think a bit to figure out what was in John’s mind. R. D. Laing, a Scottish psychiatrist, made these puzzles famous with his book of poetry, Knots.22 22 R. D. Laing, Knots (New York: Vintage Press, 1972). Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 169 Language in Conversation Linguists spend much of their time studying the formal structure of a language, a tradition that goes back to Chomsky’s early work. For example, if a speaker looks at you and opens a conversation with “fish,” you would be perplexed. Generally, what we say has a subject and a verb. So “fish swim” makes a lot more sense. When we speak, there is a structure to what we say, and in Chomsky’s view, the structure is innate. If you look closely at conversational exchange, it appears to have elements that are not accounted for in any formal linguistic analysis. The recent book by N. J. Enfield, How We Talk, is a remarkably insightful examination of how human conversations actually work.23 In Chapter 2, he argues that conversations have a structure governed by rules. For example, if you are in a conversation and the other person asks “What time is it?,” you will feel obligated to respond in some way. You would certainly not respond by staring at the person and say- ing nothing. The rule seems to be that you have an obligation to respond and help. As I have argued, this is evidence of our social intelligence and Michael Tomasello’s idea of shared intentionality. A second observation concerns the use of the sounds “uh” and “um.” My father was a lawyer and he preached to me for some time that I ought to get rid of these sounds in my speech. When I was younger, he’d correct me all the time. Enfield argues, these words are fundamental to the coordination of conversation. They send very subtle signals to the listener about the speaker’s intent. For example, one day after I had finished a lecture, a student approached me and asked a technical question. I began my answer with a giant, long “uuuuum.” Why? Enfield would argue that it’s a signal to the listener that I’m thinking about the answer and that one is imminent. In this particular case, I think it’s even more subtle than that. As I said the sound, I was thinking about how to respond to her. I knew the answer but there is a difference between knowing the answer and explaining it to someone who does not have the same level of technical knowledge. In essence, I was thinking about a way to respond that the student could understand. Furthermore, I was signalling to the student not to speak, because if she had spoken, it would have interrupted my train of thought. I would have had to process her second question and this would have taken me away from answering the original question. She also saw me look away and stare at the ground. With my body lan- guage and the pregnant “uuuuum,” I had sent a signal for her to keep quiet and she interpreted it correctly. Cognitivism and the Signal Grounding Problem Let’s consider language in the context of cognitivism which argues that our minds are a closed symbolic processing system. In other words, no body is required for language. Within that system, there are meanings stored for each word, and ways (grammars) of stringing 23 N. J. Enfield, How We Talk: The Inner Workings of Conversation (New York: Basic Books, 2017). 170 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation these words together into meaningful sentences. Most importantly, we don’t need our per- ception and motor systems to interpret a sentence once our central processor receives it. There is a simple thought experiment that points to the difficulty with this theory. It’s known as the Symbol Grounding Problem.24 Imagine trying to learn a foreign language with only the language’s dictionary. This would be impossible because every word would be defined in terms of others you don’t know. With only the dictionary, you need a way to “bootstrap” your knowledge of the language. That is, you need to learn the meaning of a sufficient number of words so that you could then take the dictionary and learn the language. To do that, there has to be something like an exchange a mother has with a child in order for a child to acquire word meanings. The child is sensitive to the social intent of the mother. This involves, for example, the mother pointing at an apple, repeating the word “apple,” and then doing this enough until the child finally makes the association between the word and the fruit. The mother engages the child mimetically until the word is learned. The key here is the word “closed” in cognitivism’s symbolic processing system. It can’t be closed. There has to be a way for a learner to pick up some words through the sort of mother–child mimetic exchange described above. The implication is that learning a language has to be embodied. Another conception of neural language processing is the Language of Thought Hypothesis which argues that our representations are translated into a special symbols and strings of these symbols are processed much like language. This special “mind language” is termed mentalese. Unfortunately, this theory also does not allow us to over- come the symbol grounding problem. With mentalese, we’re just adding another layer to the problem. The Critical Period Hypothesis We’re best able to access our language facility when we’re young. Children who are deprived of language in their early development really struggle to acquire language later. This idea is referred to as the Critical Period Hypothesis. Naama Friedmann and Dan Rusou have writ- ten an excellent review of the literature.25 The latest research suggests that children must be exposed to language in the first year of life. Interestingly, the Critical Period Hypothesis also applies to congenitally deaf children. Deaf children of deaf parents who are exposed to sign language in their first year have a much easier time learning to sign than those deaf children born to hearing families where sign instruction usually begins later. 24 Stevan Harnad, “The Symbol Grounding Problem,” Physica D 42, (1990). 25 Naama Friedmann and Dan Rusou, “Critical Period for First Language: The Crucial Role of Language Input During the First Year of Life,” Current Opinion in Neurobiology 35 (Dec 2015). Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 171 8.3 How Speech and Language Change Over time, languages change and, over enough time, they change a lot. To see this, consider the first few lines of The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer (1343–1400): When that April with his showers soote The drought of March hath piercèd to the root And bathèd every vein in such liquor Of which virtúe engendered is the flower; When Zephyrus eke with his sweetè breath Inspirèd hath in every holt and heath The tender croppès, and the youngè sun Hath in the Ram his halfè course y-run, And smallè fowlès maken melody This certainly isn’t modern English, but there are hints. Why has so much change occurred? In this section, we’ll try to answer this question. As we’ll see, it has a lot to do with metaphor and the diaconatic. Linguists have done some clever research on the origins of world languages. Clearly some languages have common elements and it is these common elements which give lin- guists clues about the “tree” of language origins. “All modern languages are descended from ancient protolanguages. The protolanguage for English is Indo-European and the evidence suggests that it originated in southern Russia about 8,000 years ago. The Germanic fam- ily descended from Indo-European and subsequently, English evolved from this Germanic family. Metaphor Here is an example of a metaphor: “It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions.” A rollercoaster is a ride at a carnival and, as such, has little to do with human emotion. Yet in the context of emotion, it indicates the speaker has experienced some emotional ups and downs. So, the idea of changes in emotion over time is being compared to a ride on a rollercoaster. Effec- tively a metaphor is an attempt to understand one concept/idea in terms of another. The two objects are not the same but there’s a sense in which they are. This is our mimetic faculty at work. Another example is the word “cool.” The literal meaning for “cool” has to do with temperature. When I say “That’s cool!” I sometimes mean that it’s colder than what I expected. But cool has some metaphorical meanings and one of these dates to Shakespeare’s A Midsummer’s Night Dream (Act 5, Scene 1): Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends. 172 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation Here he uses it to describe reason which has nothing to do with temperature. In the 20th century, the word began to be used as a hip sign of approval. “That’s cool!” or just “Cool!” indicate a high form of praise and say something of the speaker’s willingness to be apart from conservative society. It’s doubtful Elizabeth II of England ever used the word this way. Almost all of our English words have multiple meanings. One is literal and the others are metaphorical. In fact, it’s hard to think of a word that doesn’t have metaphorical meanings. Think about the word “apple,” and try and generate as many idioms as you can. An idiom is a group of words whose metaphorical meaning cannot be deduced from a literal interpretation of the words (e. g., It’s raining cats and dogs”). Here is my list for apple: An apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. How about them apples? You’re comparing apples and oranges. She’s the apple of my eye. He’s a good (bad) apple. She’s apples. He upset the apple cart. Take the first sentence and imagine a person trying to learn English who has never seen this sentence and doesn’t have the same idiom in his/her first language. He or she would have great difficulty figuring out the metaphorical meaning of the sentence. It’s worth noting that metaphor is at the heart of thought. Interpreting them and inventing them requires our mimetic faculty, the ability to see the sameness in a set of objects. I’ve always felt that metaphor was the stuff of poets and writers. As this view goes, their ideas are enhanced by metaphorical flourish (“Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”) However, we all use metaphor with high frequency. Take, for example, the following sentence taken from a front-page article in the New York Times on October 14, 2017, the day I started writing this chapter: President Trump’s decision to cut off critical payments to health insurance companies ratcheted up the pressure on Congress on Friday to take action to protect consumers from soaring premiums, while also adding a combustible new issue to negotiations to avert a government shutdown this year.26 I’ve used italics to designate a few of the words/phrases used metaphorically. Let’s go over them in order: cut off: You cut off the branch of a tree; payments can’t be cut off in any literal sense of the phrase. ratcheted up: A ratchet is a mechanical device that restricts motion in one direction; using “ratcheted up” in the context of a decision is figurative. 26 Thomas Kaplan and Robert Pear, “End to Health Care Subsidies Puts Congress in a Tight Spot,” New York Times, October 13, 2017, 1. Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 173 pressure: Pressure means to apply a physical force to an object as when you apply pressure to the brakes of a car. Pressure in the context of a decision is again figurative. take: The literal interpretation of “take” means to lay hold of an object with your hands; when Congress takes action, it has no hands to grab with. Moreover, it would be tough for it to get its non-existent “hands” on Congressional “action” anyway. soar: Soar means to fly or rise high in the air. In the literal sense, birds soar but insurance premiums don’t. combustible: It means able to catch fire and burn easily. Given this literal definition, wood burns but issues don’t. That’s six metaphors in a single sentence and that’s not all of them. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (LJ) are considered to be two of the pioneers of embodied cognition. In their book, Metaphors We Live By, they argued that our conceptual systems are largely metaphorical.27 Let’s look at a couple of their examples. One concerns the concept ARGUMENT and the conceptual metaphor that ARGUMENT is WAR. On its face, argument has a lot in common with war and this is reflected in the language we use: Your claims are indefensible. He attacked every weak point in my argument. His criticisms were right on target. I demolished his argument. I’ve never won an argument with him. You disagree? OK, shoot! If you use that strategy, he’ll wipe you out. He shot down all of my arguments. For each sentence, note the italicized words and phrases could be used just as easily in sen- tences about war. Here’s another: HAPPY is UP; SAD is DOWN. They offer the following sentences by way of example: I’m feeling up. That boosted my spirits. My spirits rose. You’re in high spirits. Thinking about her always gives me a lift. I’m feeling down. I’m depressed. He’s really low these days. I fell into a depression. My spirits sank. 27 George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Metaphors We Live By (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980). Also: George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, “The Metaphorical Structure of the Human Conceptual System,” Cognitive Science 4, no. 2 (1980). 174 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation Again, I’ve marked the relevant up/down words in italics. It’s clear from these that “up” and related words are associated with feeling good and “down” words with feeling bad. If you think about it, you can come up with any number of conceptual metaphors. For example, when I decide to go to Toronto (from Kingston where I live), I sometimes say “I’m going up to Toronto.” When my relatives in Toronto talk about going to Kingston, they some- times say “I’m going down to Kingston.” This isn’t the best usage but it actually is what we say and it’s interesting to speculate where the up and down come from. I don’t know for sure but I think it has to do with the direction of water flow in the Seaway System. Just east of Kingston, Lake Ontario empties into the St. Lawrence, and the St. Lawrence flows east to the Atlantic Ocean. So, water flows in the direction Toronto to Kingston. If water flows one way and if we move against the flow, we say we are moving upstream; on the other hand, if we move with the current, we are headed downstream. So even though Kingston is at a slightly higher eleva- tion (Kingston is at 93 meters above sea level; Toronto is at 76), we Ontarians tend to think of Kingston to Toronto as “up” and Toronto to Kingston as “down.” Flow of water is important. To differentiate Paris’s Left Bank and Right Bank, you need to look in the direction of the Seine River’s flow. If you do, the Left Bank is on your left and the Right Bank is on your right. Up and down appear in other geographical contexts. Residents of Los Angeles might say “I’m going up to San Francisco” and San Franciscans might say “I’m going down to LA.” I’m guessing this has to be related to the fact that, on most maps with the usual orientation (north at the top), San Francisco would be “above” LA. With regard to religious geography, heaven is up and hell is down. One of the main points that LJ make is the enormity of the number of conceptual meta- phors and their book details an impressively long list. The interesting question is why there is so much metaphor. Metaphor and the Evolution of Language The best explanation I’ve seen is the one Guy Deutscher offers in his book, The Unfolding of Language.28 I’ll sketch some of his argument in this section. Consider a chair with four legs and let’s get in the Wayback Machine and go to the point where the first chair was built. Let’s also suppose that folks at that time were trying to come up with a name for what we call the legs. You overhear one of the woodwork- ers suggest “Stams. Let’s call them stams.” Let’s suppose that, at this time, folks already used the word “leg” for each of the two human extremities that run from our torsos to the ground; they also used it to describe the same extremities for animals. You might argue that there are other possibilities for the four supports for the table. For example, what about “slegs” (short for “support legs”) or “clegs” (short for “chair legs”)? You can see where this is going. Setting our wisdom about hindsight aside, why not just “legs”? That would cer- tainly be a little easier on your memory because there would be no need to deal with a new 28 Guy Deutscher, The Unfolding of Language (New York: Picador, 2005). Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 175 word. If you went the new word route, more than a few folks would be saying subsequently “What’d we call those four chair support thingies?” The example makes it clear that using words metaphorically makes sense because, generally, it eases the cognitive burden of remembering a new word. There is more to Deutscher’s argument. At one point, he examines a sentence that begins “Sarah was thrilled to discover that . . .”29 The sentence with its continuation is much longer but the first part of it will be enough for us to get his idea. Deutscher is an etymologist (an expert on the origins of words) so he is able to say that, had the sentence been written far enough back, it would have been: “Sarah was pierced to un-cover that . . .”30 This is certainly not modern usage. So how do we connect the two? The word “thrill” comes from the Old English verb “thrylian” which meant “pierce.”31 Deutscher explains: The current use of thrill must have started out as a metaphor with some shock value. ‘I’m thrilled to bits’ (literally, ‘I’m pierced to bits’) must have been a graphic equivalent of today’s ‘it’s killing’ or ‘smashing.’ But as the image became familiar and established, the metaphor was bleached of its vitality and died, and eventually the original sense fell by the wayside, so that today, ‘thrill’ is only a skeleton that betrays no trace of its metaphoric origin.32 Now let’s look at “discover.” “Discover” originally meant “remove the cover from” so that if someone had said “if the house be discovered by tempest . . .” he would have meant “if a storm blows the roof off the house . . .”. Clearly the meaning of “discover” has expanded since and it now means “to find out.” Today we’d never say that the house was discovered in the context of the roof coming off. Hence “thrill” and “discover” started life with specific literal meanings that were subse- quently morphed into a metaphorical use. Deutscher points out that the morphing of concrete words into abstract words and con- cepts is always in the same direction. We go from concrete to abstract. This makes perfect sense because how else are we going to get the abstract expressiveness we’re looking for? We either go with a new word or use an existing word metaphorically. If new words are relatively more difficult to remember, it has to be that literal words morphing into abstract use is the preferred path most of the time. Here is another of his examples. Consider the word “understand.” Its current meaning is abstract as it deals with the way we use our heads to make sense of something. Consider some of the current metaphors we have for “understand”: grasping the sense, catching the meaning, getting the point, following an explanation, and seeing the difficulty. Note that 29 Deutscher, Language, 124. 30 Deutscher, Language, 125. 31 Deutscher points out that the Old English word “nos-thyrl” meant “nostril” and its roots are the Old English words “nosu” (nose) and “thyrel” (hole). 32 Deutscher, Language, 125. 176 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation these are all metaphors based on concrete concepts (that is the words in italics are all used in a metaphorical sense). Deutscher then goes on to suggest that the word “understand” is likely a burnt-out metaphor we no longer use. It seems obvious that it means to “stand under” which is pretty close to “get to the bottom of.” In sum, to expand our expressive range, our only choice is the direction from concrete to abstract. The creation of expressive value by morphing concrete words into metaphorical use tends to be gradual. For most morphings, there doesn’t tend to be an obvious point where the transformation occurs. Again, let’s consider one of Deutscher’s examples. It begins with these two sentences: Are you going to the concert tonight? No, I’m gonna stay at home.33 Let’s focus on the use of the word “go” in both sentences (the italics). The first sentence employs the literal sense of the word. In the second, “gonna” is a colloquial form for “going to.” More importantly, besides this collapse in pronunciation, “gonna” is now an auxiliary indicating the future tense. In other words, it’s no longer being used in its literal sense. Deutscher then documents how this could have happened. He recounts that the earliest use of “going to do something” happened in the fifteenth century in England. Public officials in Scropton were trying to arrest a runaway. To do so they had to explain to parliament how they had lost him: as [we] were goynge to bring hym there . . . cometh one Piers Venables . . . with many others unknowen, in manere of Werre, Riote, Route, and Insurrection arraied, with force and armes, and . . . toke away the said [runaway] from theym.34 This seems pretty clear. The use of “goynge” follows the literal sense of “go” as these public officials were clearly going somewhere to do something. Deutscher then documents a few more instances where it’s questionable whether the writer intended “going somewhere to do something” or the auxiliary sense. Eventually we get to an example where its auxiliary use is clear. In April of 1642, Charles I was prevented from entering his Magazine (an arms depot). Subsequently he explained to his citizens that he expected to lose the depot: You see that My Magazine is going to be taken from Me, being My Own proper Goods, directly against My will.35 He is using “go” in its auxiliary sense to indicate the future. Deutscher goes on to explain that the use of “go” as an auxiliary eventually made it into usage books. In 1642, the linguist Joshua Poole wrote “. . . ‘going to’ is the signe of the Participle of the future, as . . . ‘I am going to read’ . . .”36 33 Deutscher, Language, 146. 34 Deutscher, Language, 148. 35 Deutscher, Language, 150. 36 Deutscher, Language, 150 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 177 Clearly the auxiliary “going to” is not a usage that originated overnight. Deutscher also points out that this same morphing of “go” into an auxiliary structure happened in a number of languages including French—“Je vais dire” means “I’m going to say.” In addition to words morphing into metaphorical use, they can also be invented and fall out of use. Fifty years ago, there was no word “email.” Most new words tend to reflect cultural shifts. For instance, a “bromance” is a non-sexual relationship between two males; “bling” refers to expensive, ostentatious jewelry and/or clothing. Here are a few words that have fallen out of use: englishable: that which may be spoken or written in English. It originally appeared in John Ogilvie’s Comprehensive English Dictionary (1865). jargogle: to confuse, jumble as in “Your ideas have jargogled my thoughts.” anywhen: at any point in time as in “I’ll kick your butt anywhere, anywhen.” The interested reader is referred to Jeffrey Kacirk’s book for a comprehensive list of English words no longer in use.37 Eventually a metaphorical use will fall out of favour. Grammarians and style guides all share the same opinion of clichés and that’s to kill them. To show the inanity of these, Steven Pinker has used this sentence: We needed to think outside the box in our search for the holy grail, but found that it was neither a magic bullet nor a slam dunk so we rolled with the punches and let the chips fall where they may while seeing the glass as half-full—it’s a no-brainer.38 This sentence is without meaning. So metaphor goes a long way to explain how language changes. But there are forces that protect the status quo and I turn to a discussion of these now. We learn a lot of language by analogy using rules. However, in English, there are lots of exceptions to rules. I’ve already covered irregular verbs. For plural nouns, most of the time it’s enough to add an “s” as in “clocks” or “monsters” but there are a lot of irregular nouns that don’t follow this rule (e. g., mouse/mice, foot/feet, child/children). This irregularity makes it difficult to learn English. It’s so much easier to follow a general rule than internalize a long list of exceptions. What is so wrong with “Yesterday I seed three mouses!” Why don’t we use “thot” to spell “thought”? Again, I think the answer lies in the Saxe Principle. As a young boy, I don’t remember any difficulty learning irregular verbs. It also wasn’t so difficult to learn the other two irregularities I mentioned as well as the many others that exist. That I know of, there is no new gene floating around that somehow prevents our children from learning language irregularities. About the only folks who find it difficult are the adults who 37 Jeffrey Kacirk, The Word Museum: The Most Remarkable English Words Ever Forgotten (New York: Touchstone, 2000). 38 See https://youtu. be/OV5J6BfToSw?t=1054. 178 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation have to learn a new language. What is your vote? Do we want to change our spoken language so that adult non-speakers find it easier to learn? I’m guessing you’d vote the way I would. Those of you who are interested in the nature of the “rules” of English usage and like to laugh might consider reading David Foster Wallace’s piece in Harper’s “Tense Present” which begins: “Did you know that probing the seamy underbelly of U. S. lexicography reveals ideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervour on a nearly hanging- chad scale?”39 You will see how the Saxe Principle goes a long way to explain why our decen- tralized system of usage is so resistant to change. A last issue is how we got to irregularity in the first place. Obviously English is descended from a number of languages. A lot of our irregularity can be traced directly to these. Clearly, once irregularity creeps in, it’s hard to change as we’ve argued above. This is especially true when the irregularity is with verbs and nouns that we used frequently. So, “I goed to the store yesterday” is not likely to be acceptable any time soon. The Role of Metaphor in Reasoning We’ve seen that language is full of metaphor. It makes sense, then, to examine its influence on thought. Paul Thibodeau and Lera Boroditsky report some experimental work on the influence of metaphor in the way we see social problems.40 They look at our approach to crime and first observe that, in discourse, we employ two main metaphors. One is the VIRUS metaphor: CRIME is a DISEASE (crime waves, crime epidemic plaguing or infecting a city). The other is the BEAST metaphor: CRIME inflicted by BEASTS (crimes are attacks, crimi- nals prey on unsuspecting victims, criminals are hunted, tracked, and captured). They then ask whether people will have different solutions to the problem of crime depending on which metaphor they are cued with. They assigned their experimental subjects to one of two groups. All experimental sub- jects read a report that documented rising crime rates in the city of Addison. For half of these subjects, the problem was framed with the VIRUS metaphor; for the other half, with the BEAST metaphor. The actual paragraphs used were these: Crime is a {beast/virus} ravaging the city of Addison. Five years ago Addison was in good shape, with no obvious vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, in the past five years the city’s defense systems have weakened, and the city has succumbed to crime. Today, there are more than 55,000 criminal incidents a year - up by more than 10,000 per year. There is a worry that if the city does not regain its strength soon, even more serious problems may start to develop. Note that the two descriptions differ by only one word (one description uses “beast”; the other uses “virus”). The experimenters then asked subjects what they thought should be 39 David Foster Wallace, “Tense Present,” Harper’s, April, 2001, 40. 40 Paul Thibodeau and Lera Boroditsky, “Metaphors We Think With: The Role of Metaphor in Reasoning,” PLoS ONE 6, no. 2 (2011). Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 179 done to solve the problem. Sure enough, subjects presented with “beast” suggested that law enforcement was the solution; the other group of subjects, those presented with “virus,” was much more likely to suggest medical treatment. This is clear evidence that language influ- ences thought. Pidgins and Creoles A pidgin is a rudimentary language formed when two peoples with different native languages share the same geographic location usually for some common purpose such as trade. Pidgins usually have a very simple grammatical structure with words borrowed from both parent languages. Generally, a creole arises when a pidgin becomes the native tongue of the prog- eny of those who initiated the pidgin. Over a number of generations, the children are able to modify the pidgin to arrive at a full vocabulary and complex grammar. In effect, the creole is a sophisticated language that develops out of the pidgin. Here are examples of Tok Pisin sentences, a creole serving as the national language of Papua New Guinea (the translations are underneath each example): Sapos yu kaikai planti pinat, bai yu kamap strong olsem phantom. (If you eat plenty of peanuts, you will come up strong like the phantom.) Fantom, yu pren tru bilong mi. Inap yu ken helpim mi nau? (Phantom, you are a true friend of mine. Are you able to help me now?) Fantom, em i go we? (Phantom, Where did he go?) You can see that there are elements of English in Tok Pisin. More generally, pidgins and creoles are strong evidence of our mimetic faculties at work. Clearly, when two groups come together with a shared purpose, communication will facili- tate their efforts. Over time, a simple language is bootstrapped and serves the purpose of enhancing cooperation. Language and the Diaconatic Our earliest evidence of the diaconatic is the manufacture of stone-tools. This occurred at two levels. Taking a piece of stone and knapping it into a final product is certainly a dia- conatic process. At the Idea Step, the knapper looks for a good point to strike the stone; at the Action Step he makes the strike, observes the “message” from the altered stone and the process begins anew. We can also think of the diaconatic at another level. Clearly, over time, we produced bet- ter and better tools using increasingly sophisticated manufacturing techniques. For example, it is clear that our ancestors used fire to heat stones before knapping because the application of the heat resulted in better flaking properties. For every improvement in tool and/or manu- facturing process, there had to have been a corresponding diaconatic process that lead to the change. 180 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation Invariably, this cultural change is driven by the interaction of human thinking and the environment. Either there is a change in the environment requiring a new tool or human ingenuity innovates a new production process that confers some sort of advantage. It’s always been our interaction with the environment that has produced cultural change. So it is with language. At the level of the word, one of us begins a particular metaphoric usage and over time this usage can catch on and survive. That is, as a result of our interaction with the world, some individual takes a word with concrete meaning and applies it an abstract concept in a metaphorical way. This is the diaconatic at work. Considered over extended time periods, the aggregate of these efforts can result in considerable change in a language. 8.4 Synthesis Gesture and speech constitute symbolic communication. There is nothing about the indi- vidual sounds of the letters making up the word “cat” that would lead you to the animal. It’s just that those of us who speak English have agreed on the meaning of the sounds “c” “a” and “t” said in quick succession. Speech is certainly embodied and preceded exographics. Speech plays two key roles in ideation. First, it is a primary medium of learning, which, as I’ll argue, is essential to get the most out of our exographics technology. Students must be taken to the edges of knowledge and this is best done with speech, exographics, and education. Second, language is the medium of the dialectic. As I’ve argued, the dialectic occurs when two or more individuals gather to discuss an issue with a view to getting to the truth. The hope is that what one individual says causes another to have a thought that he or she otherwise wouldn’t have. In my experience, the dialectic has been a highly effective way to arrive at a direction to explore. In effect, it is minds mining minds using speech. In summary, speech is important for learning and ideation. Along with exographics and communications technologies, it’s allowed us to build advanced, highly innovative ideation networks.","length":64337,"tokens":15012,"chunks":[{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied.

It would be impossible for a single one of us to build a rocket to get us to the moon. One of our skills that enable this collaboration is speech, this ability we have to use sound to share the contents of our minds. The sound comes out as a sequence of phonemes, fun- damental units of sound which, individually are meaningless, but taken in sequence, mean something.

Therefore, the only way a nervous system can publicly display and transmit its perceptions of the world to another nervous system is to translate its perceptions into patterns of muscle movements. A mimetic act is basically a motor performance that reflects the perceived structure of the world, and its motoric aspect makes its content a public, that is, a potentially cultural, expression.3 At some point, our ancestors began to communicate in very novel ways.","content_length":902,"content_tokens":178,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"If we go far enough back, there were three ways they could have communicated: gesture-only, voice- only, and some combination of the two.

Each of these modes requires the brain to send signals along the motor neural system to the muscles it wants moved. The mode we currently use for speaking—voice and gesture—requires the brain to operate our hands, arms, and voice box. As we’ll see, most of us have difficulty producing speech if we are not able to gesture. This suggests that gesture might have deep origins.

Based on this long experience manipulating objects I have to think that our hands were a big part of the story of the origins of spoken language. Speech does have some evolutionary advantages: with speech, our hands are free for other activities and we can communicate when it’s dark.

For example, Akiba Cohen and Randall Harrison used the following methodology.5 The basic scenario was an executive explaining to a secretary the directions to different locations of interest. In one condition, the secretary asked for directions in person and in the other, by intercom.

Another possibility is that gesture helps the speaker. David McNeill reports the results of an experiment where speakers were subjected to an audio delay of their speech.7 It’s well known that the production of speech requires speakers to be able to hear what they’re say- ing.

One of the reasons is that it appears to play a significant role in our cognitive processes. Studies suggest that our blink rate falls as cognitive load increases. For example, Kenneth Wong et al. report that a surgeon will blink a lot less in the operating room.13 Presumably this is because his or her cognitive load is con- siderably higher than it would be, say, in a normal conversation.","content_length":839,"content_tokens":172,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"10 Howard Ehrlichman and John Barrett, “‘Random’ Saccadic Eye Movements During Verbal-Linguistic and Visual-Imagi- nal Tasks,” Acta Psychologica 53, no. 1 (1983) 11 Howard Ehrlichman and Dragano Micic, “Why Do People Move Their Eyes When They Think?” Current Directions in Psychological Science 21, no. 2 (2012) 12 Dragana Micic, Howard Ehrlichman, and Rebecca Chen, “Why Do We Move Our Eyes While Trying to Remember?

If we go back 6 million years when we were an arboreal small-headed ape, it’s unlikely we spoke. Something must have hap- pened in the interim. The linguist, Noam Chomsky, has argued that language was the result of an evolutionary adaptation that hard-wired an internal “universal grammar” some time ago. Indeed, the casual evidence seems to point in this direction. Children learn their native tongue effortlessly at a very early age with virtually no instruction. This includes an exten- sive vocabulary and an understanding of syntax. A little boy might say to his mother “Mom, you sit next to me” but would never say “Mom, next to me sit.” It’s also surprising how quickly children learn irregular verbs.","content_length":1124,"content_tokens":250,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"A child might say “I goed to the store” thinking that the general rule for forming the past tense of a verb is to add an “ed” to the base verb, in this case “go.” He or she infers this rule after hearing a number of sentences like “I played in the park last Saturday” or “Mom baked a cake yesterday.” He or she would eventually notice or be told that some verbs are different, and would figure out that the correct syntax for the original sentence is “I went to the store.” A child does not have to sit at a desk and be taught the past tense of all of the irregular verbs. He or she learns these with little help and effort. Chomsky calls this phenomenon the poverty of the input to recognize that children learn the rules of language with very little experience. This is his main argument for the existence of an innate scaffolding for language.","content_length":846,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"An implication is that if a very young child born to Chinese- speaking parents were adopted by an English couple, the child would learn to speak English as a matter of course.

Essentially the base sound is manufactured as the air passes the vocal cords. Subsequently this sound is modulated (changed) by the way we move and place our tongue, teeth, and lips. To see this, let’s contrast what happens when you make the sounds “pea” and “poo.” They both begin the same way: you close your mouth and build air pressure against it. To make the “pea” sound, my lips seem to move inward as I open my mouth; but to make the “poo” sound, they move out.","content_length":741,"content_tokens":183,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Now consider what happens when you make the “d” (“dee”) sound. Your tongue attaches to the top of your open mouth, air pressure is built up, and the tongue is moved to release the air and generate the sound. Nobody has to teach us how to make these sounds. We learn them early on with little effort. Our speech musculature is complex. But its control is the really interesting aspect. Your brain has to control all of the fine motor movements required in the vocal tract in addition to deciding what to say. As we all know, this muscle control is done effortlessly. We don’t have to think about it because it’s all done subconsciously. In fact, we don’t think much about the fine detail of what we want to say. When we speak contemporaneously, we generate a rough idea of what we want to say and then it comes out with only the briefest of previews.","content_length":849,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"As it turns out, our hearing is important in the delivery of speech. The evidence for this is the effect on speech that young children experience subsequent to losing their hearing. Produc- ing good speech requires auditory feedback.

One side takes the position that they do not have the vocal tract to replicate human speech (the so- called “peripheral hypothesis”); the other believes they don’t have the required neural capa- bility (the “neural hypothesis”) Based on a sophisticated simulation, Tecumseh Fitch et al. have recently argued that monkey vocal tracts are capable of speech and, with their model, demonstrate that a monkey could say “Will you marry me?”16 Their conclusion is that nonhu- man primates can speak but don’t yet have the neural wiring for it.","content_length":841,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"In a comment published in the same journal, Philip Leiberman questions the result.17 He argues that nonhuman primates cannot produce the quantal vowels (the vowels in the words “see,” “do,” and “ma”), a result 15 Daniel Everett, How Language Began: The Story of Humanity’s Greatest Invention (London: Profile Books, 2017); and Cecilia Heyes, Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2018) 16 Tecumseh Fitch, Bart de Boer, Neil Mathur, and Asif Ghazanfar, “Monkey Vocal Tracts are Speech-ready,” Science Advances 2, no. 12 (2016) 17 Philip Lieberman, Philip, “Comment on: Monkey Vocal Tracts are Speech-ready,” Science Advances 3, no. 7 (2016)","content_length":693,"content_tokens":197,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"166 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation that Fitch et al. would concede.

Regardless of the actual reason, it serves to emphasize that a lot has to go right for a species to speak as we do. Speech and Meaning Language is made up of fundamental sounds called phonemes. For example, the word “team” comprises the sounds “t,” “E” (the long “e,” pronounced as the “ee” in “teeth”), and “m.” Each of these is meaningless. Yet when they’re said in the particular sequence—t-E-m—they constitute a word (morpheme) with a meaning we all know.","content_length":753,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Linguists term this fact that you can get something meaningful from meaningless parts the dual patterning of language. There is a further combinatorial aspect of language. We use words to form sentences. These sentences are constructed according to rules which linguists refer to as syntax. The number of sentences each of us can form is limitless. For some of these, it might be the first time they’ve ever been uttered by any human being. Hence, with just 42 phonemes, we can produce an unlimited number of sound sequences, each with an associated meaning. One of the more remarkable things about speech is our ability to translate sound to meaning. Here we’ll just look at the basics. The normal rate for the speed of speech delivery is about 12 phonemes per second.","content_length":769,"content_tokens":161,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"The sentence “In hell, I’ll be in good company” totals 21 phonemes which means, at a speed of 12 phonemes per second, it could be said in under 2 seconds.

This is surprising when you consider that a discrete “beep” played at 20 times per second (or higher) sounds like an uninterrupted sound.18 Unfortunately, our ability to recall auditory input is limited. For instance, imagine listen- ing to this sequence of letters “g,s,r,a,e,e,e,d,n,i” and then having to repeat it once the list was finished. This is difficult because we just can’t put this input to memory fast enough.","content_length":755,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"If we try hard to remember it as it comes out, we miss some of the later input.

Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater term this the now or never bottleneck and it’s certainly an appropriate name for the phenomenon.19 The problem of speech is one of understanding what a sequence of words means. There have been a number of models of how the mind actually ascribes a meaning to language. One that makes a lot of sense to me is embodied simulation. The idea is that when we hear a sentence, we actually attempt a simulation in our minds of what is suggested in the sentence. 18 Michael Eysenck, Psychology: An International Perspective (New York: Psychology Press (Taylor and Francis Group), 2004)","content_length":801,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"19 Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater, “The Now-or-Never Bottleneck: A Fundamental Constraint on Language,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 39, no. e62 (2016) Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation 167 Let’s try an experiment.

For the first, I actually pictured Boyden himself prostate on the snow with a bloodied mouth. So my character was male. For the second, my image of the Huron leader was an older man with indigenous facial features and long grey hair. It was a dirty grey, not yet white. As it turns out, all of us tend to build a simulation of this action in our minds.

The interested reader is referred to Benjamin Bergen’s book, Louder Than Words, for an excellent introduction to embodied simulation.21 There are some other tricks we employ to ascribe a meaning to the whole. First, we don’t put to memory all of the words we hear. Instead, we store a meaning that we call the gist, an effect that psychologists call the verbatim effect. For instance, if someone tells you the story The Three Little Pigs, you can retell the story but not with the same words the teller uses.","content_length":782,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"You’re able to keep track of the main ideas in the story and your mind fills in the rest as you reconstruct it. The second trick is anticipation. Imagine someone said to you a sentence with six words and the first five are “How do ya like them ..” Another word is coming and you expect that it’s “apples.” As someone speaks, your mind is automatically forming expectations of the next word. Here’s another interesting aspect of speech interpretation. Most people believe we per- ceive speech only with our ears. That’s not true. It turns out that we also “see” speech. 20 Joseph Boyden, The Orenda (London: Oneworld Publications, 2013), 5. 21 Benjamin Bergen, Louder Than Words: The New Science of How the Mind Makes Meaning (New York: Basic Books, 2012)","content_length":754,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"168 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation My best friend’s father is an example.

Let’s now have a look at the fascinating gymnastics our minds do to extract meaning. We’re very good at filling in details not explicitly covered by the speaker. A good example of this skill can be found in the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a test of Artificial Intel- ligence (AI) proposed by Hector Levesque (University of Toronto) The WSC is a successor to the Turing Test, the original test of AI proposed by Alan Turing (1912–1954 CE) in 1950.","content_length":746,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"It’s based on a specific set of questions that Terry Winograd, a Stanford computer science, suggested to test AI.

Enfield, How We Talk, is a remarkably insightful examination of how human conversations actually work.23 In Chapter 2, he argues that conversations have a structure governed by rules. For example, if you are in a conversation and the other person asks “What time is it?,” you will feel obligated to respond in some way. You would certainly not respond by staring at the person and say- ing nothing. The rule seems to be that you have an obligation to respond and help.

They send very subtle signals to the listener about the speaker’s intent. For example, one day after I had finished a lecture, a student approached me and asked a technical question. I began my answer with a giant, long “uuuuum.” Why? Enfield would argue that it’s a signal to the listener that I’m thinking about the answer and that one is imminent.

I would have had to process her second question and this would have taken me away from answering the original question. She also saw me look away and stare at the ground. With my body lan- guage and the pregnant “uuuuum,” I had sent a signal for her to keep quiet and she interpreted it correctly.

Most importantly, we don’t need our per- ception and motor systems to interpret a sentence once our central processor receives it. There is a simple thought experiment that points to the difficulty with this theory. It’s known as the Symbol Grounding Problem.24 Imagine trying to learn a foreign language with only the language’s dictionary.

This involves, for example, the mother pointing at an apple, repeating the word “apple,” and then doing this enough until the child finally makes the association between the word and the fruit. The mother engages the child mimetically until the word is learned. The key here is the word “closed” in cognitivism’s symbolic processing system. It can’t be closed. There has to be a way for a learner to pick up some words through the sort of mother–child mimetic exchange described above.

On its face, argument has a lot in common with war and this is reflected in the language we use: Your claims are indefensible. He attacked every weak point in my argument. His criticisms were right on target. I demolished his argument. I’ve never won an argument with him. You disagree? OK, shoot! If you use that strategy, he’ll wipe you out.

It’s clear from these that “up” and related words are associated with feeling good and “down” words with feeling bad. If you think about it, you can come up with any number of conceptual metaphors. For example, when I decide to go to Toronto (from Kingston where I live), I sometimes say “I’m going up to Toronto.” When my relatives in Toronto talk about going to Kingston, they some- times say “I’m going down to Kingston.” This isn’t the best usage but it actually is what we say and it’s interesting to speculate where the up and down come from.

So even though Kingston is at a slightly higher eleva- tion (Kingston is at 93 meters above sea level; Toronto is at 76), we Ontarians tend to think of Kingston to Toronto as “up” and Toronto to Kingston as “down.” Flow of water is important.

With regard to religious geography, heaven is up and hell is down. One of the main points that LJ make is the enormity of the number of conceptual meta- phors and their book details an impressively long list. The interesting question is why there is so much metaphor. Metaphor and the Evolution of Language The best explanation I’ve seen is the one Guy Deutscher offers in his book, The Unfolding of Language.28 I’ll sketch some of his argument in this section.","content_length":731,"content_tokens":185,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Consider a chair with four legs and let’s get in the Wayback Machine and go to the point where the first chair was built.

Let’s call them stams.” Let’s suppose that, at this time, folks already used the word “leg” for each of the two human extremities that run from our torsos to the ground; they also used it to describe the same extremities for animals. You might argue that there are other possibilities for the four supports for the table. For example, what about “slegs” (short for “support legs”) or “clegs” (short for “chair legs”)? You can see where this is going.","content_length":731,"content_tokens":200,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Setting our wisdom about hindsight aside, why not just “legs”?

If you went the new word route, more than a few folks would be saying subsequently “What’d we call those four chair support thingies?” The example makes it clear that using words metaphorically makes sense because, generally, it eases the cognitive burden of remembering a new word. There is more to Deutscher’s argument. At one point, he examines a sentence that begins “Sarah was thrilled to discover that","content_length":717,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":".”29 The sentence with its continuation is much longer but the first part of it will be enough for us to get his idea. Deutscher is an etymologist (an expert on the origins of words) so he is able to say that, had the sentence been written far enough back, it would have been: “Sarah was pierced to un-cover that   .”30 This is certainly not modern usage. So how do we connect the two? The word “thrill” comes from the Old English verb “thrylian” which meant “pierce.”31 Deutscher explains: The current use of thrill must have started out as a metaphor with some shock value.","content_length":575,"content_tokens":155,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"‘I’m thrilled to bits’ (literally, ‘I’m pierced to bits’) must have been a graphic equivalent of today’s ‘it’s killing’ or ‘smashing.’ But as the image became familiar and established, the metaphor was bleached of its vitality and died, and eventually the original sense fell by the wayside, so that today, ‘thrill’ is only a skeleton that betrays no trace of its metaphoric origin.32 Now let’s look at “discover.” “Discover” originally meant “remove the cover from” so that if someone had said “if the house be discovered by tempest   .” he would have meant “if a storm blows the roof off the house   .”","content_length":604,"content_tokens":181,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Clearly the meaning of “discover” has expanded since and it now means “to find out.” Today we’d never say that the house was discovered in the context of the roof coming off. Hence “thrill” and “discover” started life with specific literal meanings that were subse- quently morphed into a metaphorical use. Deutscher points out that the morphing of concrete words into abstract words and con- cepts is always in the same direction. We go from concrete to abstract. This makes perfect sense because how else are we going to get the abstract expressiveness we’re looking for? We either go with a new word or use an existing word metaphorically. If new words are relatively more difficult to remember, it has to be that literal words morphing into abstract use is the preferred path most of the time.

Note that 29 Deutscher, Language, 124. 30 Deutscher, Language, 125. 31 Deutscher points out that the Old English word “nos-thyrl” meant “nostril” and its roots are the Old English words “nosu” (nose) and “thyrel” (hole) 32 Deutscher, Language, 125. 176 Chapter 8 Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation these are all metaphors based on concrete concepts (that is the words in italics are all used in a metaphorical sense)","content_length":744,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Deutscher then goes on to suggest that the word “understand” is likely a burnt-out metaphor we no longer use. It seems obvious that it means to “stand under” which is pretty close to “get to the bottom of.” In sum, to expand our expressive range, our only choice is the direction from concrete to abstract. The creation of expressive value by morphing concrete words into metaphorical use tends to be gradual. For most morphings, there doesn’t tend to be an obvious point where the transformation occurs. Again, let’s consider one of Deutscher’s examples. It begins with these two sentences: Are you going to the concert tonight? No, I’m gonna stay at home.33 Let’s focus on the use of the word “go” in both sentences (the italics) The first sentence employs the literal sense of the word.","content_length":789,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"In the second, “gonna” is a colloquial form for “going to.” More importantly, besides this collapse in pronunciation, “gonna” is now an auxiliary indicating the future tense. In other words, it’s no longer being used in its literal sense. Deutscher then documents how this could have happened. He recounts that the earliest use of “going to do something” happened in the fifteenth century in England. Public officials in Scropton were trying to arrest a runaway. To do so they had to explain to parliament how they had lost him: as [we] were goynge to bring hym there    cometh one Piers Venables    with many others unknowen, in manere of Werre, Riote, Route, and Insurrection arraied, with force and armes, and","content_length":712,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"toke away the said [runaway] from theym.34 This seems pretty clear. The use of “goynge” follows the literal sense of “go” as these public officials were clearly going somewhere to do something. Deutscher then documents a few more instances where it’s questionable whether the writer intended “going somewhere to do something” or the auxiliary sense. Eventually we get to an example where its auxiliary use is clear. In April of 1642, Charles I was prevented from entering his Magazine (an arms depot) Subsequently he explained to his citizens that he expected to lose the depot: You see that My Magazine is going to be taken from Me, being My Own proper Goods, directly against My will.35 He is using “go” in its auxiliary sense to indicate the future.","content_length":752,"content_tokens":175,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"Deutscher goes on to explain that the use of “go” as an auxiliary eventually made it into usage books.

Fifty years ago, there was no word “email.” Most new words tend to reflect cultural shifts. For instance, a “bromance” is a non-sexual relationship between two males; “bling” refers to expensive, ostentatious jewelry and/or clothing.

Grammarians and style guides all share the same opinion of clichés and that’s to kill them. To show the inanity of these, Steven Pinker has used this sentence: We needed to think outside the box in our search for the holy grail, but found that it was neither a magic bullet nor a slam dunk so we rolled with the punches and let the chips fall where they may while seeing the glass as half-full—it’s a no-brainer.38 This sentence is without meaning.","content_length":777,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"So metaphor goes a long way to explain how language changes.

For plural nouns, most of the time it’s enough to add an “s” as in “clocks” or “monsters” but there are a lot of irregular nouns that don’t follow this rule (e. g., mouse/mice, foot/feet, child/children) This irregularity makes it difficult to learn English.

It makes sense, then, to examine its influence on thought. Paul Thibodeau and Lera Boroditsky report some experimental work on the influence of metaphor in the way we see social problems.40 They look at our approach to crime and first observe that, in discourse, we employ two main metaphors.

They assigned their experimental subjects to one of two groups. All experimental sub- jects read a report that documented rising crime rates in the city of Addison. For half of these subjects, the problem was framed with the VIRUS metaphor; for the other half, with the BEAST metaphor. The actual paragraphs used were these: Crime is a {beast/virus} ravaging the city of Addison. Five years ago Addison was in good shape, with no obvious vulnerabilities.

Pidgins and Creoles A pidgin is a rudimentary language formed when two peoples with different native languages share the same geographic location usually for some common purpose such as trade. Pidgins usually have a very simple grammatical structure with words borrowed from both parent languages. Generally, a creole arises when a pidgin becomes the native tongue of the prog- eny of those who initiated the pidgin. Over a number of generations, the children are able to modify the pidgin to arrive at a full vocabulary and complex grammar.

Language and the Diaconatic Our earliest evidence of the diaconatic is the manufacture of stone-tools. This occurred at two levels. Taking a piece of stone and knapping it into a final product is certainly a dia- conatic process. At the Idea Step, the knapper looks for a good point to strike the stone; at the Action Step he makes the strike, observes the “message” from the altered stone and the process begins anew. We can also think of the diaconatic at another level. Clearly, over time, we produced bet- ter and better tools using increasingly sophisticated manufacturing techniques.

Either there is a change in the environment requiring a new tool or human ingenuity innovates a new production process that confers some sort of advantage. It’s always been our interaction with the environment that has produced cultural change. So it is with language. At the level of the word, one of us begins a particular metaphoric usage and over time this usage can catch on and survive.

There is nothing about the indi- vidual sounds of the letters making up the word “cat” that would lead you to the animal. It’s just that those of us who speak English have agreed on the meaning of the sounds “c” “a” and “t” said in quick succession. Speech is certainly embodied and preceded exographics. Speech plays two key roles in ideation. First, it is a primary medium of learning, which, as I’ll argue, is essential to get the most out of our exographics technology. Students must be taken to the edges of knowledge and this is best done with speech, exographics, and education. Second, language is the medium of the dialectic.","content_length":821,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Speech and the Origins of Symbolic Representation","content":"As I’ve argued, the dialectic occurs when two or more individuals gather to discuss an issue with a view to getting to the truth.

Francisco de Quevedo (1580–1645 CE), from his poem From the Tower The dialectic is the process where two or more thinkers come together to engage in a discus- sion about an issue. The intent is not to debate but to try, jointly, to get to an understanding or solution. In the Latin, “dia” means “through” and “lectic” means “speaking” so dialectic is loosely translated “through speaking”. It’s an ancient technique that goes back at least to the Greeks. Plato took the position that writing was a poor substitute for the dialectic for two reasons. First, he felt that writing on a page couldn’t “defend itself.” Second, writing would weaken the memory which he felt essential to the dialectic. When I think alone, I sometimes get into a sort of loop. For example, a while ago I was trying to recall the name of the President of France (Emmanuel Macron). When I searched my memory, the only thing I could draw up was “macaroon.” You get stuck because we all have a LTM with an associative structure. For example, when English speakers are asked what word comes to mind in response to the stimulus “cat,” most respond “dog.” So when you engage in a discussion, sometimes what another participant says causes you to think a thought you otherwise might not have and this is precisely because of your associative memory! In my experience, I’ve been amazed at how effective these dialectic discussions are for generating good ideas. Effectively, the dialectic creates a “network stir” of ideas and is sometimes why we conclude that two heads are better than one. Certainly, there are some famous pairs where together they appeared to be better than they were individually. For example, in modern music, the names Lennon/McCartney, David/ Bacharach, and Rogers/Hammerstein come to mind. Larry David and Gerry Seinfeld co- wrote Seinfeld. Francis Crick and James Watson discovered the shape of the DNA molecule. 181 182 Chapter 9 The Diagraphic In endeavours like software development, entertainment, and industrial production, we tend to work in groups. Most importantly our assault on the A Class is a group effort. Plato’s error was that he thought of the dialectic and writing as a dichotomous choice. He didn’t allow for the possibility that both were effective tools for thinking. We understand this today and this brings me to the point of this chapter. We can extend this idea of the dialectic to all that has been written on a topic. Usually, it’s easy to access this material and this allows me to read what others think about it. When I read what others think, it stimulates my think- ing and causes me to think differently. Hence, we can think of the expanse of what’s been written on a topic as the equivalent of speakers in a conversation. I read what they write and, more often than not, this changes my thinking about the problem. I then publish my ideas on the topic and this may influence the thought of other individuals. I am going to refer to these “conversations” among silent interlocutors as the diagraphic meaning “through (dia) writing (graphic).” Effectively the diagraphic is a slow, asynchro- nous, visual dialectic. Most importantly, I propose the diagraphic as a massive extension of the dialectic. It doesn’t replace the dialectic but rather supplements it. It’s a recognition that our attack on the A Class is a social endeavour. Newton understood this when he claimed “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”1 9.1 Some Examples To motivate the importance of the diagraphic, I’ll look at the reading of several prominent scientists, two who lead the Scientific Revolution, Copernicus and Newton, and then three in the modern era: Wilbur and Orville Wright, and Jack Kilby, a co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Copernicus We know that Copernicus had an extensive collection of books and manuscripts. Gutenberg innovated his printing press about 1450 CE and Copernicus was born in 1473 CE. He pos- sessed four incunabula (incunabula is the name given to printed books produced before 1501): Euclid’s Elementa Geometriae (1482 CE); Albohazen Haly’s In Iudiciis Astrorum (The Judgements of the Stars, 1485 CE); Alfonso X’s Tabula Astronomicae (1490 CE); and Regiomontanus’s Tabulae Directionum et Profectionum (1490 CE). He also had a copy of Regiomontanus’s Epitoma in Almagestum Ptolemei (1496 CE) and also Aratus’s Soli Phenomena (1499 CE). In sum, Copernicus was in possession of all of the texts in astronomy available at the time, as well as a copy of Euclid’s Elements. This put him in a position to be able to work on his heliocentric model. The printing press had arrived at just the right time for him. 1 Newton wrote this in a 1675 CE letter to a fellow scientist Robert Hooke, whom he disliked intensely. Because Hooke was a very short man, some historians have suggested that Newton was disparaging him with this comment. Newton Newton (1642–1726 CE) was born on Christmas Day, a few months before Copernicus published De Revolutionibus Orbium Cœlestium and was raised on the family farm in Woolsthorpe about 150 kms north of London. He had two extraordinary mathematics teachers: Henry Stokes at the grammar school in Grantham and then Isaac Barrow, the first Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1665 and, because of the plague, spent the next two years in Woolsthorpe. He returned to Cambridge as a teaching fellow in 1667 and in 1669 was appointed the second Lucasian Chair with Barrow’s recommendation. It was over these early years, particularly during the plague years (1665–1667 CE) that Newton accomplished much, particularly in mathematics. We now know that he did a lot of reading over these two years. Frederick Rickey suggests the following impressive list: The works that Newton chose to read in 1664 and 1665 magnificently met these needs. He took his arithmetic from Oughtred, his geometrical from Descartes. Of course, he grafted on new modifications of his own while creating the calculus. He learned elementary scholastic logic in grammar school and traditional forms of mathematical proof from Euclid. He learned the new analytics geometry of the seventeenth century from Schooten and de Witt, topics in algebra and the theory of equations from Viète, Oughtred, Schooten and Wallis. Most importantly, he learned of the twin problems of infinitesimal analysis: From Descartes, the method of tangents; from Wallis, quadrature . . . Without doubt the two strongest influences on Newton were Descartes and Wallis.2 The Newtonian scholar Derek Woodside comments on the relative importance of Descartes and La Géométrie: What appears to me ever more clearly to be the decisive event guiding the future direction of Newton’s mathematical thought and practice was his reading of Descartes’ Geometrie in the late summer of 1664. . . . Above all, I would assert, the Geometrie gave him his first true vision of the universalizing power of the algebraic free variable, of its capacity to generalize the particular and lay bare its inner structure to outward inspection.3 Descartes’ was crucial because it gave Newton the critical tool of analytic geometry, the link between geometry and algebra. Like Copernicus, Newton had a large personal library. When he died, he left over 2,000 volumes to his nieces and nephews. 2 V.

I do not know the terms on which you send out your publications but if you will inform me of the cost I will remit the price.5 This is a well-written letter which makes clear that Wilbur had already begun a read- ing program. The Smithsonian sent back a list of books as well as four pamphlets from the Smithsonian Reports. In a subsequent letter he requested that Smithsonian send him Langley’s Experiments in Aerodynamics. On November 27, 1899, Wilbur wrote the U. S. Weather Bureau for weather reports, par- ticularly wind average and maximum velocities in Chicago in August as the brothers planned to do manned gliding experiments.6 He later wrote again asking about wind speeds in other locales and this is how they settled on Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on the Atlantic coast as the location for their experiments. In May, 1900, Wilbur wrote his first letter to Octave Chanute, an engineer and well- known source of knowledge on flight. At the end of the letter, Wilbur wrote this paragraph: I have your Progress in Flying Machines and your articles in the Annuals of ’95, ’96, & ’97, as also your recent articles in the Independent. If you can give me information as to where an account of Pilcher’s experiments can be obtained I would greatly appreciate your kindness. (Wilbur Wright’s letter to Octave Chanute dated May 13, 1900 / on page 19) Chanute wrote back a warm letter with some pamphlets and a long reading list for the Wrights. These letters were the beginning of a long correspondence between Wilbur 4 Marvin McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1953). 5 McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright, 4–5. 6 McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright, 12. and Chanute. By my count, Wilbur wrote Chanute 108 letters over 1900–1904. In many of Chanute’s responses, he was answering questions Wilbur had asked. For example, here is Chanute’s letter of August 14, 1900: I have your letter of 10th inst. You can obtain spruce from Keith Lumber Co. Cor 14th and Wood Sts. Chicago It should be sapwood, clear, straight-grained, and thoroughly seasoned; but as this is an Eastern wood I should judge you can get it to better advantage in Cincinnati. I enclose a paper of mine, published last year in Germany, in which you will find (page 39) a recipe for the varnish which I have found the best. I have also used “spar varnish” but it does not shrink the cloth.7 Many of Chanute’s responses were, like this one, well-written, to the point, and helpful. The complete correspondence is fascinating to read. The two were engaging in a slow dialectic that was most helpful to the Wrights (and probably to Chanute). Eventually Chanute visited the brothers in Kitty Hawk to observe the experiments. The other thing that is clear is that both brothers read all they could about what was known of flight. The diagraphic played a significant role in the story of powered flight. Jack Kilby Jack Kilby (1923–2005 CE) was a co-inventor of the integrated circuit, a fundamental idea critical to our modern information technology ecosystem. The integrated circuit is a very large electronic circuit etched on semi-conductor material, an idea Kilby came to in 1958 after a blue-chip education in electrical engineering. Here is T. R. Reid’s description of Kilby’s reading: Kilby himself reads, not skims but reads, two or three newspapers every day and a dozen magazines or so each week. In addition he devours books; his office looks like a publisher’s warehouse where the books have staged a coup. For years, Kilby took the time to read every new patent issued by the U. S. government.8 Then he quotes Kilby: “You read everything—that’s part of the job. You accumulate all of this trivia, and you hope that someday maybe a millionth of it will be useful.”9 The dia- graphic was clearly important to Kilby. 7 McFarland, The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright, 22–23. 8 T.

Chapter 9 The Diagraphic 185 186 Chapter 9 The Diagraphic Frederick Douglass Frederick Douglass (1818-1895 CE) was born a slave in the United States. With the help of his future wife, a free black women, he escaped from his owner, and took a train to New York where he declared himself a free man. He became a great orator, writer, and public intellec- tual. Using these public fora, Douglass put pressure on President Lincoln and his Republican Party to allow Blacks to fight for the Union. Eventually Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War. Douglass met Lincoln in the White House three times and, by the end of the war, they had become friends. When Lincoln was assassinated, Doug- lass said this “A simple leaden bullet and a few grains of powder are sufficient in the shortest limit of time to blast and ruin all that is precious in human existence.” When Douglass was a slave at the house of James Auld in Baltimore, Auld’s wife began to teach him how to read when he was about 12 years old. Auld soon discovered this and for- bade her to continue. By then, Douglass was too advanced in his studies to turn back. In his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845), Douglass writes about his first glimpses of the power of reading and writing: It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. Over his life, Douglass wrote three autobiographies. Besides “Narrative,” he also wrote My Bondage and My Freedom, and Life and Times of Frederick Douglass. He also began his own newspaper, The North Star. When Douglass died, he left his children over a thousand books and it’s from a sample of these that we can get an idea of what he valued.10 He certainly read widely but his primary interests were history, literature and poetry, and, most importantly, a genre I call the contem- porary injustice literature. His reading in history included Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Henry Thomas Buckle’s History of Civilization in Eng- land, and Horace Greeley’s The American Conflict. In literature, he read Dumas, Dickens, Thackery, Goethe, Eliot, Shakespeare, and Homer. His poetry reading included anthologies and collections from Tennyson, Byron, Keats, Burns and Wordsworth. Finally, his injustice reading included books largely about the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, and voting rights. A sampling of these volumes included Works of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Narrative of Sojourner Truth, and Susan B. Anthony’s History of Woman Suffrage. 10 See the website https://www. artofmanliness. com/living/reading/the-libraries-of-great-men-frederick-douglass/#:~:text=He%20 read%20anything%20he%20could,on%20freedom%20and%20human%20rights. Chapter 9 The Diagraphic 187 Douglass was passionate about ideas. In his essay Self-Made Man, he had this to say about the tendency of some not to explore ideas deeply: We have all met a class of men, very remarkable for their activity, and who yet make but little headway in life; men who, in their noisy and impulsive pursuit of knowledge, never get beyond the outer bark of an idea, from a lack of patience and perseverance to dig to the core; men who begin everything and complete nothing; who see, but do not perceive; who read, but forget what they read, and are as if they had not read; who travel but go nowhere in particular, and have nothing of value to impart when they return. This is a remarkably prescient observation that certainly applies today. Katherine Johnson Katherine Johnson (1918–2020 CE) was a rocket scientist and a black woman. Born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, she was a special student, beginning high school at age 10 and university at age 14. She graduated from West Virginia State College summa cum laude at age 18. At West Virginia State, she took every math course available including a special course that W. W. Schieffelin Claytor (3rd black American to get a PhD in mathematics) offered called Analytic Geometry and Space. Eventually this course would come in very handy in her future work. This sketch suggests that Johnson had plenty of ability and read a lot about mathematics over the tenure of her degree and beyond. Johnson eventually started to work at NASA calculating trajectories for rocket flights into space. She calculated the trajectory and launch window for the 1961 Mercury flight of Alan Shepherd, the first American in space. In addition, she estimated where Shepherd would return to Earth very accurately. NASA began using computers for the first time to calculate trajectories, launch windows, and return points for John Glenn’s flight, where the plan was to orbit the Earth. Glenn refused to take this flight until the numbers the computer pro- duced had been verified by Johnson. He asked specifically for Johnson to do the verification. Johnson continued to do these calculations for the Apollo program including the flight of Apollo 11 which delivered astronauts to the moon. She also had a hand in the calculations to bring Apollo 13 safely back to Earth after the nearly disastrous explosion on board. Johnson continued to work at NASA well into the Space Shuttle program and also looked at the plans to go to Mars. It is remarkable that Johnson did as well as she did as a black woman working with white male engineers. There was overt gender and racial discrimination when she first started to work at NASA and it continued in more subtle ways as her career progressed. She offered this on gender discrimination: We needed to be assertive as women in those days—assertive and aggressive— and the degree to which we had to be that way depended on where you were. 188 Chapter 9 The Diagraphic I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their names on the reports—no woman in my division had had her name on a report. I was working with Ted Skopinski and he wanted to leave and go to Houston . . . but Henry Pearson, our supervisor—he was not a fan of women—kept pushing him to finish the report we were working on. Finally, Ted told him, “Katherine should finish the report, she’s done most of the work anyway.” So, Ted left Pearson with no choice; I finished the report and my name went on it, and that was the first time a woman in our division had her name on something.11 It’s clear from my reading that women in that era were thought not to have the same potential as men in the field of engineering. This was true even of a woman who graduated university summa cum laude in mathematics at age 18. Barack Obama awarded Johnson the Presiden- tial Medal of Freedom just before she died. These last two examples—Frederick Douglass and Katherine Johnson—make it clear that, even today, we are not making full use of our imagination resources. White men are, at best, 30% of the US population. Think of what we could achieve if women, African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, and other minorities took their proper place in our collab- orative imagination networks at the frontiers of the A Class. We need to throw off the chains of gender, colour, and religious bias. 9.2 Diagraphic: Search and Access Contributors to the A Class require their imaginations and the support of exographics. But, an imagination has to be prepared. This happens as a result of education and a part of this education is being able to access and search the ideas of others. Hence the clear communica- tion of ideas is important. The key is that the diagraphic have some form of organization so that it can be searched. The Organization of the Book At the time the codex was innovated, there were no page numbers, sectional headings like chapters, or other constructs for its organization. We’ve done a lot more with the basic design since. Consider a basic university textbook. The textbook’s pages are numbered and it con- tains a Table of Contents and an Index. If a reader wants to look at what the book has to say on a particular topic, he or she can go to either the Table of Contents or the Index to see what pages to turn to. We have specialized texts called dictionaries which enable us to look up the meanings of words we don’t know or are uncertain about. These are in alphabetic order of the words so it’s easy to find a particular word. One only needs to know the orders of the letters. I still make use 11 See https://static1. squarespace. com/static/5c65dd81af46834afd07e40a/t/60cef48da9202f72b0f283ae/1624175761866/ lives+retold+johnson+katherine. pdf of the “abc” song I learned early in primary school to check the relative positions of the letters. We have dictionaries of idioms for people trying to learn a language. If you don’t know what “an apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” means, you can look it up. There are also dictionaries for synonyms and antonyms called thesaurus’s so you can find alternatives for a given word. The Organization of the Traditional Library Libraries are largely bricks and mortar institutions that hold large collections of physical books, periodicals, encyclopaedias, journals, archival collections, and other material. A mod- ern library also has electronic access to large databases of books, journals, and periodicals. A main concern is the organization of this information. Library users have needs, and to satisfy these needs, books and other printed fora are arranged so that, in principle, a library user should be able to easily access the required reading. In this regard, it’s worth looking at a brief history of this organization. The earliest evidence we have of a library goes back to Nippur in Mesopotamia about 2,000 BCE. In that collection of tablets, there is one tablet with a list of 62 titles, suggesting that it might be a catalog.12 At Nineveh, in 650 BCE, there is the Library of Ashurbanipal (the Assyrian king) which held over 20,000 tablets and many of these have significant bib- liographic information including a title (usually the first few words of the tablet), the original writer, the scribe if it was a copy of the original, and a stamp of the king. However, no cata- logue of the library holdings has ever been found. Regarding the great Greek library at Alex- andria, there are only references to the catalogue (his so-called “Pinakes”) that Callimachus supposedly produced in about 250 BCE. This catalogue is not enlightening: it only gives the first few lines of the manuscript and the author/scribe. The science of library organization does not really advance until the 16th century. In about 1560, Florian Trefley, a Benedic- tine monk, published research on how to organize a catalogue. He was the first to use call numbers, a system which allows users to get the call number of a book they are interested in from a catalogue, and then quickly go to the point in the library where that call number is located to find the volume they want. It was certainly a clever idea, and one we still use today. Remarkably, it took 3,500 years to come to. In today’s library systems, there are many ways (by title, by author, by subject, etc.) for a user to find the call number of the book, paper, periodical, etc., they wish to find. The Idea of a Universal Library In 1545, the physician and naturalist Conrad Gessner (1516–1565 CE) published Bibliotheca Universalis, a catalogue of all of the known works of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew writers who had ever lived. It was in alphabetic order by author. For each of about three thousand authors, there was an entry for each book the author wrote that included the title of the book and a 12 Ruth French Strout, “The Development of the Catalog and Cataloging Codes,” The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy 26, no. 4 (Oct., 1956): 255. Chapter 9 The Diagraphic 189 190 Chapter 9 The Diagraphic brief annotation. Twelve thousand titles were listed. Gessner was known as the “father of bibliography.” From here, it was a short jump to a single library containing all that had been written, the so-called universal library. The modern counterpart would be a digital universal library. With the invention of high- speed computing, high speed mobile computing, the Internet, and modern search engines like Google, such a high-tech library would give everybody access and be easily searched. It would be accessible from anywhere at any time. Gessner’s dream could be reached with the push from technology! One of the noteworthy attempts at a digital universal library was Google’s in the early 2000s. Larry Page and Sergy Brin, the co-founders of Google, had always had the idea of a digital, searchable library and they set about the task in 2002. They first approached the University of Michigan which agreed to let “Project Ocean” digitize seven million books. In return, the university would get unlimited access to the database. Google developed the technology to do the digitization but it still required a human in the loop to turn pages. Each book took about 40 minutes to copy. Google made the same deal with a number of other libraries including those of Stanford, Harvard, and Oxford. Of the 125 million books avail- able at the time, Google managed to digitize 25 million of them at a cost of $400 million. Unfortunately, the project hit a snag when authors objected because they thought their copy- rights were being infringed. The story gets complicated at that point.13 To make a long-story short, there was a class action suit brought by authors and publishers against Google and this group was successful in killing the project. As Somers notes though, there was almost an agreement until the U. S. Department of Justice weighed in against the deal. The database now sits unused in Google offices. There are other universal library projects with similar goal statements. Here is one from MIT’s Institute-wide Task Force on the Future of Libraries: The Task Force and the community members we heard from envision the library as a networked set of global platforms replete with content, data, metadata, images, audio files, laboratory notebooks, course materials, and more. We imagine a repository of knowledge and data that can be exploited and analyzed by humans, machines, and algorithms. This transformation will accelerate the accumulation and validation of knowledge, and will enable the creation of new knowledge and of solutions to the world’s great challenges. Libraries will no longer be geared primarily to direct readers but instead to content contributors, community curators, text-mining programs, machine-learning algorithms, and visualization tools. The MIT Libraries should operate as an open digital platform, available for all manner of research and development projects emanating from within and beyond MIT. While we recognize that many relevant applications and 13 The interested reader is referred to James Somers’s article in The Atlantic: “Torching the Modern-Day Library of Alexandria,” April 20, 2017. programs already exist, our platform must be flexible enough to permit those future uses of our data that we cannot yet imagine. The Task Force expects the MIT Libraries to act as both application developer and as a supporting hub for developers across the globe.14 This is a remarkable statement and certainly much more ambitious than the Google project. First, note that the digital library content will include more than just digitized books. It will also incorporate a capability to grow in real time and this growth will include apps that incorporate the library’s data as input. It’s not really surprising that MIT, an engineering school, would see it as just another problem with a relatively straightforward technology solution. However, I think there is more to it. Let’s raise a few issues. There is a difference between information and knowledge. I don’t want to get into epistemology, the philosophical problem of how we get to knowl- edge. Rather I simply want to point out that information and data are generally inputs to arriving at knowledge. For example, for a considerable period of time, Charles Darwin collected information about various species trying to explain the variation in species. In the Galapagos, he observed finches with quite different beak shapes and structure. He later reasoned that these different beaks were an adaptation to the type of food the finches were eating depending on their location. In one location, where seeds were plentiful, the finches developed much bigger beaks capable of breaking the seeds to begin the process of digestion. At other locations, finches had smaller beaks because there diet was insects which did not require a large beak to break. These observations of beak size and location were some of the data (information) that Darwin used to arrive at his theory of evolu- tion by natural selection (knowledge). In this case, reasoning with information leads to knowledge. Astronomers have observed that the galaxies of the universe are moving further apart. To see how galaxies could be moving further apart, imagine drawing small circular dots on a balloon with no air in it. Now begin to fill the balloon with air. As you do this, you will see the dots on the surface of the balloon get further away from one another. This, along with other evidence, led astronomers to the Big Bang Theory of how the universe started. About 14 billion years ago, as this theory goes, the universe consisted of a single massive point which then exploded. So, information (the universe is expanding) leads to knowledge (the Big Bang Theory). In time, it could turn out that there is some other explanation for how the universe began, but for now, the Big Bang Theory is a reasonable explanation. Imagine ancient astronomers observing the skies. The movements of the Sun and Moon (information) led them to the theory that all heavenly bodies rotate around the Earth (knowl- edge). This was Ptolemy’s Geocentric Theory and it survived for the better part of 1,500 years until Copernicus suggested his ideas. Chapter 9 The Diagraphic 191 14 Available at: https://future-of-libraries. mit. edu/sites/default/files/FutureLibraries-PrelimReport-Final. pdf. 192 Chapter 9 The Diagraphic It’s human nature to try to explain what we don’t understand. We look at information and then reason knowledge. The story, at any point in time, is provisional. It satisfies an itch until a better theory comes along. This gets us to the issue of how we judge a theory to be good, or in other words, how we know that our knowledge is good knowledge. Moreover, let us restrict ourselves to the writ- ten record. How do we assess a new theory, or a new novel, or a new medical practice? Let’s focus on a new academic theory. Most new academic ideas are in a specific discipline. The author of the idea writes a book or paper outlining his or her idea and sends it to an editor of a journal or a book publisher. In turn, these editors will seek the opinion of experts in the writer’s field for an assessment. This is termed peer review and, with this opinion, the editor will make an assessment of whether to publish the idea. If the editor decides no, that’s usu- ally not the end for the idea. The author will continue to send it to other journals and pub- lishers until somebody picks the idea up or the author decides to put the idea on the shelf. Suppose you’re an economist and you wish to publish a new idea. Let’s suppose you feel your paper makes an interesting point about crypto-currency and the money supply and you’d like to find a good journal to submit it to. If you’ve been working at a university as an economics professor, you know the good journals, so it’s a matter of choosing one, and then following their submission guidelines. Typically, you would do this online. In this pro- cess, your final step is usually to attach a PDF file of your paper and then hit the “Submit” button. To get an idea of the vastness of the economic literature, let’s have a look at the website for Research Papers in Economics (RePEc). The first paragraph at this site describes what RePEc does: RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) is a collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in 102 countries to enhance the dissemination of research in Economics and related sciences. The heart of the project is a decentralized bibliographic database of working papers, journal articles, books, books chapters and software components, all maintained by volunteers. The collected data are then used in various services that serve the collected metadata to users or enhance it.15 I studied some economics during my doctoral studies and wanted to see if I could find Rich- ard Lipsey’s early paper on the Theory of the Second Best. Sure enough, I found it in a matter of a few seconds by doing a search within RcPEc and then Google. This paper is now consid- ered to be fundamental to Welfare Economics. I can recall having the pleasure of attending a summer research seminar at Queen’s University in my first summer of doctoral studies where Lipsey was the guest speaker. In that talk he recounted that, regarding the Theory of the Second Best paper, he reckoned that he had enough rejection letters from journal editors 15 http://repec. org/. to paper his bedroom. Sometimes new ideas are so revolutionary, so far from the received literature, that they take a long time to get published. RcPEc provides information on 3,787 economics journals. That’s an astonishingly high number. They also rank these journals in a number of ways. Using an “impact factor” over the most recent 10 years of data, The Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE) is the highest ranked economics journal. Let me explain how this impact factor works. Over a period of ten years, the QJE published 370 papers. Other papers in other journals cited these 370 papers a total of 25,967 times. A citation happens when, say, an article in the American Economic Review, includes one of 370 QJE papers in its reference list. The impact factor, then, is 25,967/370 = 70.18. Effectively it’s the average number of times that each of the QJE papers is cited by papers in other journals. This is a reasonable measure of the average importance of QJE articles over the last ten years. In addition to journals, RcPEc lists and ranks 5,417 working paper series, 539 book series, and 328 book chapter series. There is a lot of space available to publish economic ideas. This space has grown significantly in the last 20 years for a number of reasons. One of the reasons for this large expansion has been the staggering growth in Open Access (OA) journals since 2007. An OA journal is one where authors pay a fee to have their work published but, once published, the papers are free for everybody to read. On the other hand, with subscription journals, an author publishes without a fee and then readers typically have to pay a fee to read. Traditionally, universities have purchased a subscription to a journal to have the journal for professors and students to read. Typically these come in hard copy and digitally. These subscriptions are expensive, and some of them exceed $15,000 per year. However there is a problem with OA journals. These journals, largely digital, make more money the more articles they publish. Consequently, some of them relax the peer review of submitted articles to maximize revenues. This is considered a real problem and various lists of these predatory publishers have been made. Yet most of them are still in business and their number has grown significantly. Some of these journals have been revealed through “sting” efforts, where an academic writes a nonsense paper and then tries to have it published in a sample of these journals. A good example is the work of John Bohannon which he describes in a paper published in Science.16 Summary The thinking on the possibility of a universal library seems to fall on one of two possible lines. There are those who feel that technology will eventually solve the problem. Others see it as a myth primarily because the avalanche of information in such a library would get in the Chapter 9 The Diagraphic 193 16 John Bohannon, “Who’s Afraid of Peer Review?,” Science 342, no. 6154 (2013). 194 Chapter 9 The Diagraphic way of producing new knowledge, new insights from all that information.17 I’ll have more to say about this momentarily. 9.3 Google and the Diagraphic It takes a lot of education to get to the frontiers of the A Class. We go through about two decades of instruction to get to the point where some can begin to contribute to the A Class. As individuals proceed through this educational process, most will specialize in a discipline. They become experts in that discipline and in order to contribute, they’ll have to be aware of what other like-minded scholars have done. They spend a lot of time studying the A Class texts of their discipline. Eventually, they may offer a contribution and present it to a wider community. It will go something like this: colleague A thought this, colleague B thought that and colleague C’s idea is close to A’s idea. Colleague D, who is new to this area of the A Class but is certainly educated enough to be able to discover ideas in this proximity, then sees that there is some unexplored space that the other three haven’t looked at and decides to see what that exploration might yield. When D finds something interesting, he or she will submit it for publication. Then A, B, and C will read D’s idea and pass judgement on it. If they find some faults with the idea, D will try to repair them in a revised draft. With luck, the idea will pass muster in the community. This is the diagraphic. It’s a slow “dialectic” with text and it’s an important part of the process we use to add to the A Class. What has made this visual dialectic go more quickly is the technology supporting it. Tim Berners-Lee designed the World Wide Web in 1989–90. This gave us a way to share hyper- text documents across a network of computers. It was McLuhan’s global village almost over- night. All of us are familiar with the Internet now and we understand that it’s a wonderful way to share information. We can now share text, data, and ideas in real-time with internet video-conferencing technologies. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergy Brin made another great contribution. They gave us a way to search the Internet for the specific information we happen to need. When I was working on this book, I got interested in Inuit C Class ideation. At one point, I wanted to know about harpoon design and how these designs changed over time. My Google search call was: “history of inuit harpoon design, pdf”. The first website Google suggested turned out to be a PDF version of the book Ancient Harpoon Heads of Nunavut: An Illustrated Guide by Robert Park and Douglas Stenton.18 It goes into tremendous detail about the design and construction of harpoons for a variety of purposes. I’ve rarely been disappointed with my 17 Miroslav Kruk, “The Internet and the Revival of the Myth of the Universal Library,” The Australian Library Journal 48, no. 2 (1999). 18 It can be found at http://parkscanadahistory. com/publications/north/nunavut-harpoon-heads. pdf. The citation is: Robert Park and Douglas Stenton, Ancient Harpoon Heads of Nunavut: An Illustrated Guide (Ottawa: Parks and Recreation Canada, 1998). Google searches. After a while you develop good instincts for the right keywords and you’re usually able to get the information you require. The Google search algorithm is remarkable. We input some search keywords and phrases, and it then produces a ranked set of websites where we might be able to find the information we’re seeking. The algorithm does this almost instantaneously. Google does not share information about its software and hardware. However, there are estimates that it currently supports 2.5 million servers in warehouses across the globe and these support 60,000 searches per second. They’ve developed all of their specialized hardware and soft- ware, something no other firm does. As I have already remarked, Google now (2022) has competition but still maintains a dominant market share. I think it’s safe to say they these competitors are going to continue to refine their algorithms and Internet search technolo- gies will get better over time. The Internet and search engines like Google have been a godsend to those working in the A Class. I do not feel that there is an avalanche of information. Moreover, when it comes to the diagraphic, I can easily find what others in the A Class community think about a par- ticular topic or idea with simple searches of internet data either using Google or the refined search tools within a discipline. I’m not sure whether we should call this a universal library. What I do know is that it works really well for me, and more generally, for all of the wider diagraphic conversations that occur minute to minute around the globe.","length":42161,"tokens":9475,"chunks":[{"title":"The Diagraphic","content":"Withdrawn into the peace of this desert, along with some books, few but wise, I live in conversation with the deceased, and listen to the dead with my eyes.

Effectively, the dialectic creates a “network stir” of ideas and is sometimes why we conclude that two heads are better than one.

Rather I simply want to point out that information and data are generally inputs to arriving at knowledge. For example, for a considerable period of time, Charles Darwin collected information about various species trying to explain the variation in species. In the Galapagos, he observed finches with quite different beak shapes and structure. He later reasoned that these different beaks were an adaptation to the type of food the finches were eating depending on their location.

Astronomers have observed that the galaxies of the universe are moving further apart. To see how galaxies could be moving further apart, imagine drawing small circular dots on a balloon with no air in it. Now begin to fill the balloon with air.

Most new academic ideas are in a specific discipline. The author of the idea writes a book or paper outlining his or her idea and sends it to an editor of a journal or a book publisher. In turn, these editors will seek the opinion of experts in the writer’s field for an assessment.

An OA journal is one where authors pay a fee to have their work published but, once published, the papers are free for everybody to read. On the other hand, with subscription journals, an author publishes without a fee and then readers typically have to pay a fee to read. Traditionally, universities have purchased a subscription to a journal to have the journal for professors and students to read. Typically these come in hard copy and digitally. These subscriptions are expensive, and some of them exceed $15,000 per year. However there is a problem with OA journals. These journals, largely digital, make more money the more articles they publish. Consequently, some of them relax the peer review of submitted articles to maximize revenues.

Douglass was born a slave but became one of the leading public intellectuals of the 19th century. Once we’ve come to our A Class idea, we then will share it with others by writing (and sometimes publishing) a document. Generally, this finished exographic is in standard writ- ten English (SWE, or, for this chapter, “writing”). Sometimes it might have the expanded semasiographic symbol set of whatever discipline it falls into. Regardless of whether it’s semasiographic or glottographic, we’re writing in sentences and paragraphs that accord with the rules of SWE. If your idea is a good one, it will make its way to the diagraphic, the written record of all A Class ideas. There it will be examined and quite possibly used by other scholars, thinkers, and innovators who may see a way to push your work forward. So finished exographics is an important skill. Your ideas will gain wider acceptance if you explain them clearly and concisely. In this chapter, I’ll first look at the importance of finished writing. Then I’ll suggest how best to enhance your skill. 10.1 The Importance of Finished Exographics In my opinion, the most important skill you will develop at university and college is how to write clearly. Yes, you will take away a lot of knowledge and thinking skills from whatever disciplines you study. But by far the most important skill is your ability to communicate by writing out your thoughts. 197 198 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics If you’re a student, you probably don’t believe me. But don’t take my word for it. Here is the opinion of the legendary advertising executive David Ogilvy: “The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy & Mather. People who think well, write well.”1 This is taken from a 1982 internal memo he delivered to employees. From the same memo, he offers a corol- lary: “Woolly minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly speeches.” In a NY Times article entitled “What Corporate America Can’t Build: A Sentence,” Sam Dillon quoted a “woolly” email from a Silicon Valley systems analyst to a superior: I updated the Status report for the four discrepancies Lennie forward us via e-mail (they in Barry file) . . . to make sure my logic was correct It seems we provide Murray with incorrect information . . . However after verifying controls on JBL—JBL has the indicator as B ????—I wanted to make sure with the recent changes—I processed today—before Murray make the changes again on the mainframe to ‘C’.2 © New York Times. I can’t imagine this email made any sense to the person who received it. When you get out into the working world, you are likely to have to write and some of you will write a lot. If the first thing you write for a superior is poor, you might get lucky if he or she continues to believe you’re smart but that you just haven’t been taught how to write. Another possible outcome is that he or she might begin to believe that you don’t think well. We all know the wisdom on first impressions. The tech entrepreneur Kyle Wiens is a stickler for good writing. In his Harvard Business Review piece titled “I Won’t Hire People Who Use Poor Grammar. Here’s Why,” he explains that all those interviewed at his firms iFixit and Dozuki take a grammar test.3 He feels writ- ing ability is highly correlated with other skills he values like job performance, creativity, and intelligence. A number of academic studies have surveyed American industry to determine the impor- tance of writing in the workplace. In his 2016 doctoral thesis, Clay Aschliman replicated an earlier study by the College Board’s National Commission on Writing for America’s Families, Schools, and Colleges’ (NCW) 2004 report, “Writing: A Ticket to Work . . . Or a Ticket Out.”4 He concludes that, on average, businesses are placing an increased emphasis on writing, that job applicants with good writing skills are more likely to be hired, and that employees with good writing skills are more likely to be promoted. Clearly writing skills have economic value. 1 David Ogilvy, edited by: Joel Rafaelson, The Unpublished David Ogilvy (London: Profile Books, 2012). 2 Sam Dillon, “What Corporate America Can’t Build: A Sentence,” NY Times, Dec 7, 2004, available at: https://www. nytimes. com/2004/12/07/business/what-corporate-america-cant-build-a-sentence. html. 3 Available online at: https://hbr. org/2012/07/i-wont-hire-people-who-use-poo#:~:text=If%20you%20think%20an%20 apostrophe,you%20might%20make%20it%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D 4 Clay Aschliman, “Write to Work: The Use and Importance of Writing as Perceived by Business Leaders,” PhD Thesis, Virginia Commonwealth University, 2016. Jeff Bezos, until recently the CEO of Amazon, has insisted that his executives write 4-page narrative memos on business proposals. At a meeting to consider a proposal, those at the meeting spend the first part of it in silence reading the memo. Only then does discussion begin. In his now-famous 2004 memo outlawing PowerPoint for such meetings, Bezos wrote: “The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than ‘writing’ a 20 page PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understand- ing of what’s more important . . . and how things are related.” I play golf with Paul Langlois, a member of the Tragically Hip, one of Canada’s finest rock bands. We had occasion to exchange a series of emails over an issue at our golf club and I noticed that he was a very good writer. I complimented him and asked if there was a person in his past who had helped him to learn to write. He responded with this: If I had to pick someone who influenced and helped my writing the most, I’d pick my Grade 13 English teacher at KCVI, Morna Macodrum. She was an excellent teacher and always made her class interesting and fun. She was very passionate about all writing, and loved to read and to talk about novels (especially anything by her hero Margaret Lawrence). Lawrence is not everyone’s cup of tea but I was in because Ms. Macodrum’s enthusiasm for her really shone through. She was also very encouraging to both Gord Downie and me that year. Obviously we noticed, and partly because of that and the fact that we were best friends, we ended up in a sort of unspoken friendly competition to win the English award. In what turned out to be a win for many people in many places, I won the award, just inching Gord out. I say that because I know that it frustrated the hell out of him at the time, and I think in part it made him more determined to be the poet/writer he wanted to be. All credit to him and to her of course, but I privately take a little for myself!5 Contributed by Paul Langlois. © by Kendall Hunt Publishing Company. That’s a well-written email. Gord Downie is the deceased frontman and chief lyricist of The Hip. The band has put together some of the most iconic songs in Canadian rock history and no doubt Ms. Macodrum’s passion played a role in Downie’s lyrics. What is noteworthy is that two bona fide rock stars were at the top of their English class in the year they graduated from high school. Both went on to university studies until the band’s early success drew them away. Within the Canadian Armed Forces, senior officers are required to write one-page sum- maries of proposals for senior decision boards made up of 3- and 4-star generals including the Chief of the Defence Staff. These are not overnight memos. Every word is carefully con- sidered. Most officers spend weeks drafting them. 5 Communicated by email, Dec 4, 2021. Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 199 200 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics Getting back to the academic world, let me describe two instances where writing is important to me. Sometimes I’ve had difficulty putting some of my ideas into words. What I’ll do is write what I think the idea is, and then read what I’ve written to see if it works. I’m usually able to say right away whether the passage I’ve written captures the idea. If it does, fine. Otherwise, I go back to the drawing board. Sometimes I can revise what I’ve written but, at other times, I just start the whole passage again. This brings to mind the dictum of novelist William Faulker: “I never know what I think about something until I read what I’ve written on it.” The point is that I use writing to clarify an idea in my mind. This is hard work but it’s very useful. Once I have it in writing, I understand my idea. I also use writing to understand the ideas of others. I now make notes on the important reading I do. Typically, these are short notes but they force me to think through the point an author is trying to make as well as the supporting argument. For instance, if I want to understand, say, an opinion piece from the NY Times, I’ll go through the article and make short bullet points (rough exographics) which summarize the argument. With these, I’ll write the note. 10.2 The Neuroscience of Writing My expertise is not neuroscience, but if you look at this literature as it relates to writing, you’ll see that writing employs quite a few different areas of the brain. Since writing is a relatively recent cultural phenomenon, perhaps this is not surprising. Let’s look at the brain areas that we draw on when we write. Frontal Lobe. This is the area in the front of the brain that serves as a controller. It’s where we plan and decide. If I ask you to write a paragraph on how evolution works, this is where you’ll plan and manage the writing of it. Hippocampus. Your hippocampus is involved in the formation and retrieval of long-term memories. Some of your writing will be drawn from this source. Broca’s Area. This part of the brain enables you to translate your ideas into exographics. People with damage to it, say Broca’s aphasia, are able to understand the requirements of a writing assignment, but cannot produce the required exographics (or the spoken equivalent of the exographics.) Wernicke’s Area. This part enables you to check whether the writing on the page matches the idea you intended. Someone with damage to the area can speak, but what comes is usu- ally gibberish. Visual Cortex. This area is in the back of your head. Suppose you were asked to describe the layout of your home in a paragraph. Then your visual cortex would light up as you use your “mind’s eye” to inform your writing. Speech Area. Experienced writers sometimes show significant activation in that part of Broca’s Area dedicated to speech as though they are having an internal conversation as they work through a writing exercise. Motor Area. As you write, the part of the brain controlling your physical movements is hard at work. It has to control your eye movements and your arm and hand movements. This is pretty amazing. When writing, we focus on the idea. We don’t think at all about the move- ments we are making. Caudate Nucleus. This is a structure deep within the brain and it appears to have something to do with skill development in the sense that, when practicing a skill, the caudate nucleus is activated. It seems to be involved in coordinating the brain regions that are involved in executing the skill. When experienced writers are at work, this part of the brain lights up but it doesn’t for novice writers. Since writing seems to require many parts of the brain to work together, it appears to be a significant evolutionary hack. Happily, we’re able to manage this symphony to create the symbolic representations of A Class ideas. 10.3 Finished Exographics in the Wild For some time, we entertained the so-called Stage Model of the writing process. The idea was that writers essentially went through three stages: pre-writing (or planning); writing (translation of ideas to words/prose); and re-writing (or revision). These stages were thought of as distinct in time with sharp demarcations between them. That changed with the work of Linda Flower and John Hayes in their classic 1981 paper about how writers, professional and novice, go about creating a finished exographic docu- ment.6 They proposed a Cognitive Process Model which posed the writing process as a col- lection of elementary mental activities that could be called upon at any time as the document is written. For example, when a writer is translating an idea into words, it might happen that another idea suddenly appears that requires some thought and some note-making before the writer returns to the translation process. Sometimes, in order to check whether a sentence a writer has just written makes sense, she might read the previous sentence, fully planning to then read the sentence just written to see if the two work together. If, when she reads the sentence before, she decides there is a problem and decides to revise it immediately before returning to completing the next sentence. I think the real point of the Cognitive Process Model is that writing is a messy process. It still boils down to planning, writing, and re-writing. However, there is no sense in which these stages are done sequentially or independently. This is a good example of the diaconatic in action. A writer does thousands of diaconatic iterations on the way to completing a finished exographics document. 6 Linda Flower and John R. Hayes, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing,” College Composition and Communication 32, no. 4, (December, 1981). Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 201 202 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 10.4 Some Thoughts on Teaching Students to Write7 Not much has changed since Merrill Sheils wrote “Why Johnny Can’t Write” nearly half a century ago.8 It’s not news that a large percentage of high school students don’t write well. This is consistent with testing results across the globe. For example, in 2012, the U. S. National Center for Education Statistics reported that only 27 percent of 12th-graders perform at or above the level “proficient.”9 It’s also consistent with the views of many of my university col- leagues who have bemoaned student writing skills for years. The literature on teaching students how to write is vast and I think it’s safe to say there is not broad agreement on precisely how students should be taught. However, there does appear to be a general consensus on some basic elements of a good pedagogy. One principle is to have students write more than they currently do, although researchers are quick to point out that just writing more is not a guarantee. In this regard, what happened at New Dorp High School on Staten Island in the early 2000s is enlightening.10 In 2006, stu- dents at New Dorp were not doing well academically. Their performance on national testing programs was horrendous to the point where the local Education Board put the school on notice that the Board was considering closing New Dorp in favour of newer smaller schools. The Principal, Deirdre DeAngelis, and her staff did a detailed studied of the problem and concluded that it was poor writing ability. Subsequently, in a program they called “The Writ- ing Revolution,” she and her staff introduced writing instruction in all subjects except math- ematics. The results were stunning. Shortly after their program was put in place, test scores improved considerably. Most importantly, the New Dorp graduation rate went from 63% to 80%. The surprising effect is that improving writing skills picked up student performance in all subjects. We tend to think that writing and thinking are independent. But, as I’ve argued in detail, they’re not. Most importantly, the increased emphasis on writing had a significant effect. A second principle is to assign writing exercises which ask students to comprehend and learn. I like these too. One exercise I give my students in a senior undergraduate course is the following. They first read a 4–5 page explanation of how evolution by natural selection works. Then they have to produce a single paragraph on how it works. They generally find this exercise very difficult to write. Most leave out important elements. Then we have an 7 Some of this section is adapted from a note I published in The Teaching Professor: “I’m an Applied Mathematics Professor, and Improving My Students’ Writing Ability Matters,” The Teaching Professor, Feb 14, 2022. 8 Merrill Sheils, “Why Johnny Can’t Write,” Newsweek, December 8, 1975. 9 National Center for Educational Statistics. 2012.

Then they try the exercise again. A third principle is to teach the use of modern writing tools. University and college stu- dents should have keyboarding skills and be able to sit at their computer and compose their piece. What is not discussed in this literature is one-on-one feedback. The reason is that it’s dif- ficult for teachers and professors to find the time to offer such feedback given their workloads. For example, it would be impossible for a university history professor teaching 200 students to give individual feedback on every sentence of an essay. Based on my experience, I have to think that, ideally, there are four elements that have to be present if a university or college student is going to learn to write well. First, the stu- dent has to be a reader. I think it would be difficult to become a good writer if you weren’t a reader. Reading gives a writer an ear for what sounds good and what doesn’t. Second, the student has to want to learn. There is a lot to say here so I’ll come back to this later. Third, the student has to practice writing. And fourth, the student has to have a tutor who will go over the student’s writing and show him or her how to edit and redraft. As mentioned above, the difficult nut to crack is the one-on-one feedback of a tutor. Notwithstanding this difficulty, let’s first explore its importance. One-on-One Instruction If you are going to work with students to improve their writing, I highly recommend you read Mike Rose’s wonderful book Lives on the Boundary.11 Rose taught writing at UCLA for many years. His one-on-one, compassionate approach was informed by the assump- tion that writing is an extremely difficult skill to master but one required for a student to be able to enter into the conversation on ideas. I’m guessing that Ms. Macodrum, Paul Langlois’s teacher, could tell us a lot too. Let me first offer some evidence the approach works. I’ve asked my students who can write how they learned. Invariably they can trace their development to a single person, usually a teacher or a parent. I’ve also asked a number of good professional writers the same question, and they, too, point to a single person. For example, Lewis Lapham, the American editor and essayist, learned from a graduate student at Yale. They would meet at Mory’s, and the grad student would go over Lapham’s work, sentence by sentence, explaining his errors and then how to fix them. The poster boy is the American writer Stephen King. While in high school, he worked for his hometown newspaper as a sports reporter. The editor was a fellow named Gould who turned out to be an inspiration to King: 11 Mike Rose, Lives on the Boundary: A Moving Account of the Struggles and Achievements of America’s Educationally Underprepared (New York: Penguin Books, 1989). Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 203 204 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics I took my fair share of English Lit classes in my two remaining years at Lisbon, and my fair share of composition, fiction, and poetry classes in college, but John Gould taught me more than any of them, and in no more than ten minutes.12 What Gould did was sit with King and edit the first article King wrote. At one point in the article, King had written that a particular basketball scoring record had stood “since the years of Korea.” Gould looked at King and asked what year the record had been set. King responded 1953. With that, Gould struck out “the years of Korea” and substituted “1953.” To King, this was a revelation. As he writes in his book, “Why . . . didn’t English teachers ever do this?”13 Another compelling example is the work of the American novelist Dave Eggers on his “826 Valencia” project.14 Eggers was told by family members and friends who were teachers that the solution to getting students to become good writers was one-on-one tutoring. These teachers wanted to do it, but the education system didn’t allow them the time. Eggers had recently moved from Brooklyn to San Francisco and was looking for space to house his vari- ous publishing projects including McSweeney’s Internet Tendency. He settled on 826 Valen- cia Street in the Mission District. As a result of some city zoning laws, he was required to run a business at that address. So, on the ground floor, he and his group opened a Pirate Supply Store which, in his words, carried everything the working buccaneer would ever need. At the back of the store, he and his team set up a work space where students could come in and receive free one-on-one writing tutoring mostly from professional writers. The project has been extraordinarily successful. There are over 1,400 tutors who volunteer their time and the place is full of students beginning at 2:30 pm every weekday afternoon when students get out of school. The project has now been copied in a large number of American cities. The point is that one-on-one writing instruction in a fun atmosphere works. My Approach to One-on-One Instruction I teach applied mathematics. In my senior undergraduate elective courses, largely case-based, I ask students to present their recommendations and supporting arguments in written reports to a fictional senior decision-maker. My students are in one of two groups. They are either very good writers or they struggle. For those who struggle, I have no complaint about the general logic of their writing. Their arguments are usually good. Where they are weak is in writing a grammatically correct sentence to express the particular idea they want to convey. I consider myself lucky because I don’t have large classes. Generally, I have 10–15 students in these courses, and this enables me to provide detailed feedback on each sentence a student writes. 12 Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft (New York: Scribner, 2000), 56. 13 King, On Writing, 57. 14 Eggers’ Ted Talk, at https://www. ted. com/talks/dave_eggers_my_wish_once_upon_a_school, is inspiring. His first novel, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, reached the NY Times best-seller list and was a finalist for the Pulit- zer Prize. I make my editorial suggestions to students directly in the Word files they submit. For example, here is a sentence a student wrote in a short piece to explain what he liked to read: I also enjoy reading autobiographies of people including Kurt Cobain, Andre Agassi, and Anthony Kiedis, lead singer for the red hot chilli peppers. The first thing to note is that I understand the point this student is making. However, it’s not a very well written sentence. Here is the feedback I gave this student: Is the word “reading” necessary? If you reread the sentence without it, you’ll see it’s not. It’s understood that an autobiography will be read. My first rule of rewriting is to get rid of words not required and, where pos- sible, to rewrite with fewer words. Are the words “of people” required? They aren’t. Autobiographies are always about people. Should you capitalize “red hot chilli peppers”? Yes. Proper names are normally capitalized. Is “chilli” spelled correctly? No, it’s not. The correct spelling is “chili.” Did you mean to write “autobiographies” or “biographies”? Kurt Cobain did not write an autobiography, but Charles Cross has written the biography Heavier Than Heaven. Here’s the sentence with these sug- gested corrections: I also enjoy biographies including Kurt Cobain, Andre Agassi, and Anthony Kiedis, lead singer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The sentence is still not right. I think you meant to write that you enjoy biographies and recently you’ve read those of Kurt Cobain, Andre Agassi, and Anthony Kiedis? Furthermore, why did you explain who Kiedis is but not the others? A writer needs to appreciate his audience. I may be an old fat professor, but I like rock music and I know who Anthony Kiedis is. When you explain who he is, it’s mildly insulting because you’re intimating you don’t think I know. With these consider- ations, you might rewrite as follows: I also enjoy biographies. Recently, I’ve read a biography of Kurt Cobain, and the autobiographies of Andre Agassi and Anthony Kiedis. I think these two sentences express the idea you intended. All of this for one student sentence! No doubt you are thinking that, for my part, this is a lot of work. You’re right. It is. However I reckon it’s the most important work I do. As time has passed, I’ve gotten a lot quicker at it. Each poor sentence is a puzzle to be solved. Like anything you work at, you usually get better over time. As you can see, the fixes I suggest usually boil down to logic. For example, when a student writes “autobiographies of people,” you can simply point out the redundancy. Most students Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 205 206 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics see this easily. After you point out a number of these logic issues, they begin to get it. Maybe it doesn’t come as quickly as the road-to-Damascus lightning bolt that Stephen King experienced. But most students will eventually see that writing a sentence is an exercise in logic. An important aspect of this feedback is that it not be negative all the time. When I see a good phrase, clause or sentence, I point it out and praise the student. It’s been my experience that this praise has a significant salutary effect. However, it’s also critical to point out and fix errors. When I provide feedback, I do not use the Word command “Track Changes.” If I did, a student could simply issue the command “Accept All Changes” and their revision would be done. I make all of my comments in red font and manually. This forces students to get into the file, study the suggested changes, and then actually make the changes. Another critical aspect of my approach is how I assign grades. In my courses, a student will be writing a series of case submissions. Each submission is, at most, two pages double- spaced. What I first do is get their submissions to the point where their prose meets my stan- dard. This sometimes takes two to three drafts, with each successive draft taking less time to evaluate. It’s over these drafts that I can also ask the student to consider any weaknesses in their argument. Once I get the final draft, I have my crazy brother Bob assign a final grade, which is usually 100 percent. The only students who do not get 100 percent are those who do not do the required redrafting. In these cases, I tell students that their maximum grade will be 70 percent and they’ll only get that if they have a strong argument. Most students are prepared to redraft for two reasons. First, they feel they are improving their writing, and second, they get higher marks. Some colleagues have criticized my approach to grading because they feel I am giving marks away. My position is this: If I can use the grading system to improve a student’s writ- ing by getting him or her to work harder, then that’s what I’ll do. I’m really not concerned with what colleagues think about my grading. One way to scale this approach is to have the whole class look at a poor sentence and try to fix it. I call this activity Mr. Fixit Sentence Repair Exercises. As students develop a better idea of what I am looking for, they really “get into” these exercises. You can do three to four sentences in 10 minutes so it doesn’t take up too much class time. If you do it twice per week for 14 weeks, you end up showing students how to fix well over 100 sentences. My son David (a web developer), and I edit a Substack site, Sentence Logic, which takes this Mr. Fixit approach. We take actual sentences from various sources and show, in detail, how to fix them. By studying these fixes, a student will begin to appreciate the logic of sen- tence revision. Another way I scale is with an end-of-term essay. I ask my students to write a five- to eight-page essay on a specific problem based on the subject matter of my course. Students are required to find an editor for this essay and they must submit their editor’s name and email address with the essay. I warn students that any mistake in grammar or usage will result in their maximum possible mark going from 100 percent to 70 percent. I tell them I will not assign an A or B grade to any essay that is not impeccably written. If students arrange a good editor, they will learn from the editor’s suggestions for revision. Furthermore, given the sub- ject of the essay (applied mathematics), it’s doubtful that an editor could write the paper and, when I see these essays, I’m generally confident that students have written the initial draft. There are very few essays that go to the 70 percent maximum. This is likely because students understand my feelings about the importance of writing and hence know the 70 percent threat is credible. When I find errors, I don’t automatically impose the 30 percent penalty. I’ll take into account the severity of the errors before deciding whether to penalize. I’m lenient but not too lenient. So, does my approach work? The only direct evidence I have is the feedback I receive from students in their post-course evaluations. Most of them point to my approach to their writing as different, refreshing, and helpful. Some go as far as to suggest that all courses need to take the same approach. The Ignition Point I believe emphatically that our pedagogy has to find ways to achieve the effects of the one- on-one tutor. It’s our best chance for students to get to what I call the ignition point, the point where the student moves to a new glide path, one where they will take over the responsibil- ity for learning to write. At this point, students start to see the logic of writing. They begin to write second and third drafts of their own accord. They begin to read attentively, try- ing to understand what makes good sentences good. Most importantly, they develop a new attitude: they begin to take pride in their writing by refusing to offer substandard prose to a reader. In my view, our teaching objective ought to be to get students to this ignition point. I believe elements of one-on-one instruction has the best chance to do it. As the examples above illustrate, I don’t think a student needs much one-on-one tutoring to get to the ignition point. Maybe a year would do it? I’m not sure. What About Grammar Courses? In conversations about how to deal with student illiteracy, I often hear the suggestion that students need to take a grammar course and learn how to diagram a sentence. My feeling is that grammar courses are useful but a little goes a long way. You can teach students a lot about rules with my approach, either directly or in the Mr. Fixit exercises. In addition, a stu- dent who embarks on a strong reading program will internalize the rules of grammar without explicit instruction, much the way a child learns to use irregular verbs. Grammarly? I signed up to use the free version of Grammarly and I like it. It suggests corrections for a lot of errors I don’t see as I draft a document. These corrections are easy to make. Usually it will suggest a correction you can click on to accept. My most frequent errors are spelling, Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 207 208 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics mismatched subjects and verbs, and ill-matched pronouns. I have to think, this freeware would be useful for novice writers. I have checked sentences with more complicated errors and Grammarly does not find these. Of course, maybe if I paid for the Premium version, it would sort out these problems. I’m just not sure. Books on Style? One of the best books on style is Verlyn Klinkenborg’s Several Short Sentences About Writing.15 He has much to offer the novice writer. One is this bit of wisdom: Most of the sentences you make will need to be killed. The rest will need to be fixed. This will be true for a long time.16 I’ve been writing for well over fifty years and this still holds for me, although I might change the first word of the first sentence to “Some”. In my view, the key is attitude. You have to want to keep revising your work until what you release to readers conveys what you want it to convey. Changing the Curriculum Emphasis About 15 years ago, I was sitting in my office having just marked some of the worst case write-ups I’d ever encountered. The writing has horrible, and I was thinking about what to do. I soon decided I would devote more time to their writing skills. I felt that teaching students to write a decent sentence would be more valuable to them than explaining why the Traveling Salesman Problem is NP-hard. Spending a bit more instructional time on fundamental skills makes a lot of sense. For me, it was fairly easy to take time away from some of the elective topics I normally presented toward the end of the course. 10.5 The Most Important Section in This Book for Students Let me reiterate that the most important skill you need to learn between Grade 1 and the end of university is your ability to put your thoughts on paper in standard written English. It must be your priority. I’m not naïve enough to think that all of you will buy my argument. If you’re one who doesn’t, don’t worry about it because sometimes this skill comes late as I’m about to explain. 15 Verlyn Klinkenborg, Several Short Sentences About Writing (New York: Vintage Books, 2013). 16 Klinkenborg, Several Short Sentences, 13. My Story When I graduated from university with an honours BSc in mathematics, I was proud of myself. It was a difficult program and I got through it. In the end, I had some pretty decent math skills. But I couldn’t write a sentence. I wrote one essay over the four years and it was on the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematics topic. If you asked me to write on the topic of the Carolingian Renaissance, I wouldn’t have even known what that meant, much less what to include in the piece. This all came to a head one day when I asked my father, a very good lawyer and later a judge, to read a covering letter and CV I had put together to apply for jobs. He was on his way out the door one morning going to work. He quickly read my letter, looked at me, and told me I was illiterate. That was a shock. We went over the letter that evening and he explained all the errors I had made. The one-page letter was a sea of red. After we had gone over the letter, we sat and stared at one another. Finally, he broke the ice. “Will,” he said, “educated people know how to read and write. You don’t read and you can’t write.” That also had shock value. What really hit home was the clear message that, in his view, I was not educated. For some reason, I didn’t get angry. But I did feel that maybe life was passing me by and I needed to get going. So I asked him to teach me to write. He responded that he would but only after I read for six months. The last thing I wanted to do was read because it was boring and time away from what I really wanted to do which was to play sports and socialize. I objected mildly but he would have none of it. He implored me “Will, why don’t you just give it a try! Maybe you’ll really like it.” The conversation ended there. We were both frustrated, he at my objection to do something that would be clearly beneficial, and me because the painful prospect of read- ing didn’t fit in with my plans. I thought about it for a couple of days and came around to the idea. I would give it a try. I went to Dad and asked what I should read. He had a large library so we went to it and he looked over his shelves and eventually settled on Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms. This was on a Friday night where normally I would have gone out to a bar with the gang. I decided to stay in and read. For reasons I can’t explain, I couldn’t put the book down. It was probably that I had reached my ignition point. I read until about midnight and then got up early the next day and started again. I finished it that evening and really enjoyed it. Hemingway wrote very simply. Here is the first sentence of A Farewell to Arms: In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.17 I can remember being struck by it. It was so simple. No difficult words. Few adjectives. No adverbs. No interior-sentence punctuation. That was how the book read throughout. I decided 17 Ernest Hemingway, A Farewell to Arms (New York: Scribner, 1929). Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 209 210 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics to read more Hemingway. Dad had For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Sun Also Rises, and Death in the Afternoon so I read those, then went out and purchased the rest of Hemingway’s cor- pus. When I wasn’t at work, I was reading. On weekends I read Friday nights, all day Satur- day, and all-day Sunday. From there, Dad got me reading The Globe and Mail and the periodicals that came into the house: Time, The Atlantic, Harper’s, and The New Yorker. I also continued to read selections from his library. I can remember reading Steinbeck (The Red Pony, The Grapes of Wrath, and East of Eden), John Dos Passos’s USA trilogy, Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, and Goodbye to All That, Robert Graves’ autobiography up to the point where he left England for Majorca to start a new life. When Dad passed away, I asked my siblings if I could have the first choice of his books. They agreed. I made sure that I took all those books I read when Dad was able to pry open my mind. They are very meaning- ful to me. After about six months, I asked Dad if I could start to write. Surprisingly he told me not to worry about it, that I should just keep reading. When I eventually went to graduate school, I had to start writing, and when I could, I would come home so that he could help me redraft papers by making suggestions in much the same way I do for my students now. He would explain that “biographies of people” could be simplified to just “biographies” because biographies were always about people. It was the logic of it that I started to see. From that point on, Dad read pretty much everything I wrote until his eyesight eventually gave out and he could no longer read, something that he had a very difficult time accept- ing. In all of my papers he looked at, he always wrote across the top: “Here you go Will. Take the suggestions you like and throw the rest out.” To the end, I adopted 90% of his suggestions. He was a great writer. About ten years ago, he said to me “You know, Will, you’re getting to be a pretty good writer. I don’t think you need me anymore.” Of course, you know what my response would have been and this brings me to an important point. Professional writers need editors. Editors are generally good writers who can offer a writer ways of rewriting and restructuring that the writer might prefer. As I see it, you get wed- ded to your writing and sometimes it’s not worth keeping. So if professional writers need editors, why wouldn’t amateurs? I encourage my students to find good writers to serve as their editors. (More on this in a moment.) When I look back at my education, Dad was my best teacher. He taught me the one skill critical to my career in academe and that was to put my ideas on paper simply and concisely. Yes, I learned a lot from professors along the way, particularly those who taught me in the doctoral program. But Dad taught me the skill that was most valuable to me. Finally, you can think of me as another data point along with Lewis Lapham, Stephen King, Paul Langlois, the 826 Valencia students, and my students who can write. Along the way, a good writer took us by the hand and showed us how to do it. Let’s now come back to your predicament. How You Can Do It If you don’t read, start. Read everything you get your hands on. You should spend 30–60 minutes every day on the NY Times. It’s by far the best newspaper in the world. Make sure you read some good periodicals. I like The New Yorker, Harpers, and The Atlantic but there are many other good ones. When you’re reading and come to a word you don’t understand, look it up! Then write it down along with the sentence it’s used in. If you feel you have time, try to use it in a sentence of your own. I always kept a little black book next to me so I could record the words I didn’t know. After you look a word up one or two more times, you’ll know it. If you’re reading a book where you find yourself looking up three words a page, stop reading the book. It’s not for you. Or me, for that matter. Remember my father’s advice: All educated people read. How, then, should you approach enhancing your writing skill? The approach universities and colleges take to writing within the formal curriculum, will not enhance your ability much. Yes, you might run into teachers who will make you write and give you detailed feedback but they’re the exception, not the rule. Most instructors adopt the standard university policy on writing: students are supposed to know how to write before they arrive so if they can’t, send them to the Writing Center. Usually, the Writing Center is located in some out-of-the-way building, maybe next to the physical plant or the maintenance sheds. However, there is a way for you to get that individual help. It’s going to involve some extra work on your part. But all the resources are at most universities and colleges now. Let’s assume you’ve reached the ignition point. Then what you are going to do is design your own writing courses that you will take each term over the time you’re at university or college. Let’s call them Writing 101 (first term, first year), Writing 102 (second term, first year), Writing 201 (first term, second year), and so on. You’re not going to get any credit for these courses, but these are the most important courses you’ll take. Each course has two elements. The first is as follows. You are going to walk over to the Writing Center, introduce yourself, and then ask for some help. Tell them that you plan to write a half a page a week on a topic of your choice and that you would like one of the Writ- ing Center tutors to go over those paragraphs with you to help you rewrite it. You will likely find that whoever you talk to will look at you like you have five heads. Don’t be alarmed. This is a natural reaction on their part. They’re not used to such requests and particularly where a student asks for help to edit some extra writing. But inside they’ll be tickled that you want to improve. Fix a regular time each week to visit. You can think of this as your “lecture time” for the course. I’ve included some exercises at the end of this chapter to get you going. But you should really choose what you want to write about. Try and write something about a difficult concept or idea in the courses you are currently taking. Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 211 212 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics The second element is to make a commitment that, for every writing assignment you have for your other courses, you will get the assignment done in enough time that you can take it to your tutor in the Writing Center for help to redraft it. You can sit down with your Writing Center tutor and work out a forward schedule of when you’ll visit with these papers. If your university or college does not have a Writing Center, you’re going to have to arrange a faculty member to help you. This shouldn’t be a problem. I know that if I were approached by a student with this proposition, I’d be happy to meet with the student whenever it was required. You must understand that these Writing courses are your priority. They come before everything else. Nothing is more important and if that means sacrificing marks in other courses because you don’t get assignments done, then so be it. When it comes right down to it, marks are not important. What is important is that you improve your thinking and writing skills. I can guarantee you that as you work through writing assignments, you’ll be improv- ing both. I know what some of you are thinking. But you need to take my proposition seriously. Always remember that educated people know how to write. You really need to get out and find your Ms. Macodrum. Appendix: A Few Suggestions for Your Writing 101 Course Ideally, you should select your own writing exercises from your current studies. However, in the interests of getting you going, you might consider some of the following exercises. For these, assume that the lines you write on a page are typed and double-spaced with a 12-point font. Exercise 1. Read the section of this text on how evolution by natural selection works. Then write at most half a page on how it works. Exercise 2. You can read Franz Kafka’s short story A Report to the Academy here: http:// www. kafka. org/index. php?aid=161. Summarize the story in half a page. Then write a short paragraph on why you think Kafka wrote it. Exercise 3. Read Ambrose Bierce’s short story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge which you can find here: https://americanliterature. com/author/ambrose-bierce/short-story/an- occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge. Write a synopsis of the story in no more than half a page. Exercise 4. Read Simon Winchester’s essay “Greeks Bearing Gifts” in Lapham’s Quarterly. You can find it here: https://www. laphamsquarterly. org/technology/greeks-bearing-gifts. Write half a page on his thesis and the argument he uses to support it. Exercise 5. Read Andrew Blum’s essay “Fusion and Magic” in Lapham’s Quarterly. You can find it here: https://www. laphamsquarterly. org/technology/fusion-magic. Write at most a page on his thesis and the argument he uses to support it. Exercise 6. Read this excerpt from Cervantes’ novel Don Quixote (Cervantes titled it The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha): https://core100. columbia. edu/article/ excerpt-don-quixote. This is the famous windmill scene in the novel. Cervantes wrote Don Quixote in 1612 CE and, in my opinion, it remains one of the funniest novels ever written. It’s about an older man, Don Quixote, and his younger trusty assistant Sancho Panza. Quixote and Panza set out on a knights-errant campaign in order that Quixote win the hand of a young maiden, Dulcinea, who has no idea he exists. Quixote has poor eyesight and is continually looking for grand battles to win, particularly in the proverbial “fights against the bad guys.” Write a synopsis of the scene in at most half a page. Exercise 7. Many of us are familiar with John McCrae’s In Flanders Fields. Another great World War I poet was Wilfred Owen who served in the war and died in action in November 1918, a week before the Armistice. Read Owen’s great poem Dulce et Decorum Est which you can find here: https://www. poetryfoundation. org/poems/46560/dulce-et-decorum-est. In a half a page, explain what it’s about and what his point is. Exercise 8. Listen to Steve Jobs’s famous Commencement Address at Stanford in 2005: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc. Summarize his address and what you liked about it in at most a page. Exercise 9. Read the Gettysburg Address by Lincoln at https://www. abrahamlincolnonline. org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg. htm. Write two paragraphs. The first should give some back- ground on the address. Start your second paragraph with these words “I think the address is important because . . . ”. Exercise 10. Recently Bono delivered a speech on the occasion of receiving the Fulbright Prize for International Understanding. You can listen to it here: https://www. youtube. com/ watch?v=3-cfzpVKHic&t=18s. He talks about some interesting ideas. Pick one and explain it in at most half a page.

Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 199 200 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics Getting back to the academic world, let me describe two instances where writing is important to me. Sometimes I’ve had difficulty putting some of my ideas into words. What I’ll do is write what I think the idea is, and then read what I’ve written to see if it works.

Sometimes I can revise what I’ve written but, at other times, I just start the whole passage again. This brings to mind the dictum of novelist William Faulker: “I never know what I think about something until I read what I’ve written on it.” The point is that I use writing to clarify an idea in my mind. This is hard work but it’s very useful. Once I have it in writing, I understand my idea. I also use writing to understand the ideas of others. I now make notes on the important reading I do. Typically, these are short notes but they force me to think through the point an author is trying to make as well as the supporting argument.","content_length":680,"content_tokens":160,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"For instance, if I want to understand, say, an opinion piece from the NY Times, I’ll go through the article and make short bullet points (rough exographics) which summarize the argument.

Since writing is a relatively recent cultural phenomenon, perhaps this is not surprising. Let’s look at the brain areas that we draw on when we write. Frontal Lobe. This is the area in the front of the brain that serves as a controller. It’s where we plan and decide. If I ask you to write a paragraph on how evolution works, this is where you’ll plan and manage the writing of it. Hippocampus.","content_length":816,"content_tokens":191,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"Your hippocampus is involved in the formation and retrieval of long-term memories. Some of your writing will be drawn from this source. Broca’s Area. This part of the brain enables you to translate your ideas into exographics. People with damage to it, say Broca’s aphasia, are able to understand the requirements of a writing assignment, but cannot produce the required exographics (or the spoken equivalent of the exographics.) Wernicke’s Area. This part enables you to check whether the writing on the page matches the idea you intended. Someone with damage to the area can speak, but what comes is usu- ally gibberish. Visual Cortex. This area is in the back of your head. Suppose you were asked to describe the layout of your home in a paragraph. Then your visual cortex would light up as you use your “mind’s eye” to inform your writing.

Motor Area. As you write, the part of the brain controlling your physical movements is hard at work. It has to control your eye movements and your arm and hand movements. This is pretty amazing. When writing, we focus on the idea. We don’t think at all about the move- ments we are making. Caudate Nucleus. This is a structure deep within the brain and it appears to have something to do with skill development in the sense that, when practicing a skill, the caudate nucleus is activated. It seems to be involved in coordinating the brain regions that are involved in executing the skill. When experienced writers are at work, this part of the brain lights up but it doesn’t for novice writers.","content_length":893,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"Since writing seems to require many parts of the brain to work together, it appears to be a significant evolutionary hack. Happily, we’re able to manage this symphony to create the symbolic representations of A Class ideas. 10.3 Finished Exographics in the Wild For some time, we entertained the so-called Stage Model of the writing process. The idea was that writers essentially went through three stages: pre-writing (or planning); writing (translation of ideas to words/prose); and re-writing (or revision) These stages were thought of as distinct in time with sharp demarcations between them. That changed with the work of Linda Flower and John Hayes in their classic 1981 paper about how writers, professional and novice, go about creating a finished exographic docu- ment.6 They proposed a Cognitive Process Model which posed the writing process as a col- lection of elementary mental activities that could be called upon at any time as the document is written.","content_length":967,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"For example, when a writer is translating an idea into words, it might happen that another idea suddenly appears that requires some thought and some note-making before the writer returns to the translation process. Sometimes, in order to check whether a sentence a writer has just written makes sense, she might read the previous sentence, fully planning to then read the sentence just written to see if the two work together. If, when she reads the sentence before, she decides there is a problem and decides to revise it immediately before returning to completing the next sentence. I think the real point of the Cognitive Process Model is that writing is a messy process. It still boils down to planning, writing, and re-writing. However, there is no sense in which these stages are done sequentially or independently. This is a good example of the diaconatic in action. A writer does thousands of diaconatic iterations on the way to completing a finished exographics document. 6 Linda Flower and John R.","content_length":1007,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"Hayes, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing,” College Composition and Communication 32, no. 4, (December, 1981) Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 201 202 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 10.4 Some Thoughts on Teaching Students to Write7 Not much has changed since Merrill Sheils wrote “Why Johnny Can’t Write” nearly half a century ago.8 It’s not news that a large percentage of high school students don’t write well. This is consistent with testing results across the globe. For example, in 2012, the U. S. National Center for Education Statistics reported that only 27 percent of 12th-graders perform at or above the level “proficient.”9 It’s also consistent with the views of many of my university col- leagues who have bemoaned student writing skills for years.","content_length":764,"content_tokens":180,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"The literature on teaching students how to write is vast and I think it’s safe to say there is not broad agreement on precisely how students should be taught. However, there does appear to be a general consensus on some basic elements of a good pedagogy. One principle is to have students write more than they currently do, although researchers are quick to point out that just writing more is not a guarantee. In this regard, what happened at New Dorp High School on Staten Island in the early 2000s is enlightening.10 In 2006, stu- dents at New Dorp were not doing well academically. Their performance on national testing programs was horrendous to the point where the local Education Board put the school on notice that the Board was considering closing New Dorp in favour of newer smaller schools. The Principal, Deirdre DeAngelis, and her staff did a detailed studied of the problem and concluded that it was poor writing ability.","content_length":935,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"Subsequently, in a program they called “The Writ- ing Revolution,” she and her staff introduced writing instruction in all subjects except math- ematics.

Most importantly, the New Dorp graduation rate went from 63% to 80% The surprising effect is that improving writing skills picked up student performance in all subjects. We tend to think that writing and thinking are independent. But, as I’ve argued in detail, they’re not. Most importantly, the increased emphasis on writing had a significant effect. A second principle is to assign writing exercises which ask students to comprehend and learn. I like these too. One exercise I give my students in a senior undergraduate course is the following. They first read a 4–5 page explanation of how evolution by natural selection works. Then they have to produce a single paragraph on how it works.","content_length":954,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"They generally find this exercise very difficult to write.

Then they try the exercise again. A third principle is to teach the use of modern writing tools. University and college stu- dents should have keyboarding skills and be able to sit at their computer and compose their piece. What is not discussed in this literature is one-on-one feedback. The reason is that it’s dif- ficult for teachers and professors to find the time to offer such feedback given their workloads. For example, it would be impossible for a university history professor teaching 200 students to give individual feedback on every sentence of an essay. Based on my experience, I have to think that, ideally, there are four elements that have to be present if a university or college student is going to learn to write well.","content_length":900,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"First, the stu- dent has to be a reader. I think it would be difficult to become a good writer if you weren’t a reader. Reading gives a writer an ear for what sounds good and what doesn’t. Second, the student has to want to learn. There is a lot to say here so I’ll come back to this later. Third, the student has to practice writing. And fourth, the student has to have a tutor who will go over the student’s writing and show him or her how to edit and redraft. As mentioned above, the difficult nut to crack is the one-on-one feedback of a tutor. Notwithstanding this difficulty, let’s first explore its importance.

I’m guessing that Ms. Macodrum, Paul Langlois’s teacher, could tell us a lot too. Let me first offer some evidence the approach works. I’ve asked my students who can write how they learned. Invariably they can trace their development to a single person, usually a teacher or a parent. I’ve also asked a number of good professional writers the same question, and they, too, point to a single person.

The editor was a fellow named Gould who turned out to be an inspiration to King: 11 Mike Rose, Lives on the Boundary: A Moving Account of the Struggles and Achievements of America’s Educationally Underprepared (New York: Penguin Books, 1989) Chapter 10 Finished Exographics 203 204 Chapter 10 Finished Exographics I took my fair share of English Lit classes in my two remaining years at Lisbon, and my fair share of composition, fiction, and poetry classes in college, but John Gould taught me more than any of them, and in no more than ten minutes.12 What Gould did was sit with King and edit the first article King wrote.","content_length":903,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"At one point in the article, King had written that a particular basketball scoring record had stood “since the years of Korea.” Gould looked at King and asked what year the record had been set.

As he writes in his book, “Why    didn’t English teachers ever do this?”13 Another compelling example is the work of the American novelist Dave Eggers on his “826 Valencia” project.14 Eggers was told by family members and friends who were teachers that the solution to getting students to become good writers was one-on-one tutoring.

So, on the ground floor, he and his group opened a Pirate Supply Store which, in his words, carried everything the working buccaneer would ever need. At the back of the store, he and his team set up a work space where students could come in and receive free one-on-one writing tutoring mostly from professional writers.

My students are in one of two groups. They are either very good writers or they struggle. For those who struggle, I have no complaint about the general logic of their writing. Their arguments are usually good. Where they are weak is in writing a grammatically correct sentence to express the particular idea they want to convey. I consider myself lucky because I don’t have large classes. Generally, I have 10–15 students in these courses, and this enables me to provide detailed feedback on each sentence a student writes. 12 Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft (New York: Scribner, 2000), 56.","content_length":944,"content_tokens":194,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Finished Exographics","content":"13 King, On Writing, 57. 14 Eggers’ Ted Talk, at https://www. ted. com/talks/dave_eggers_my_wish_once_upon_a_school, is inspiring.

I make my editorial suggestions to students directly in the Word files they submit.

Autobiographies are always about people. Should you capitalize “red hot chilli peppers”? Yes. Proper names are normally capitalized. Is “chilli” spelled correctly? No, it’s not.

Like anything you work at, you usually get better over time. As you can see, the fixes I suggest usually boil down to logic.

It’s been my experience that this praise has a significant salutary effect. However, it’s also critical to point out and fix errors.

Another critical aspect of my approach is how I assign grades. In my courses, a student will be writing a series of case submissions. Each submission is, at most, two pages double- spaced. What I first do is get their submissions to the point where their prose meets my stan- dard. This sometimes takes two to three drafts, with each successive draft taking less time to evaluate. It’s over these drafts that I can also ask the student to consider any weaknesses in their argument. Once I get the final draft, I have my crazy brother Bob assign a final grade, which is usually 100 percent. The only students who do not get 100 percent are those who do not do the required redrafting.

I’m really not concerned with what colleagues think about my grading. One way to scale this approach is to have the whole class look at a poor sentence and try to fix it. I call this activity Mr. Fixit Sentence Repair Exercises. As students develop a better idea of what I am looking for, they really “get into” these exercises.

I ask my students to write a five- to eight-page essay on a specific problem based on the subject matter of my course. Students are required to find an editor for this essay and they must submit their editor’s name and email address with the essay.

There are very few essays that go to the 70 percent maximum. This is likely because students understand my feelings about the importance of writing and hence know the 70 percent threat is credible.

The Ignition Point I believe emphatically that our pedagogy has to find ways to achieve the effects of the one- on-one tutor. It’s our best chance for students to get to what I call the ignition point, the point where the student moves to a new glide path, one where they will take over the responsibil- ity for learning to write.

Goody argued that literacy was the explanation for The Great Divide. Goody was not the first to suggest the idea. I. J. Gelb, in his A Study of Writing (1953), wrote this: To this statement might be added the opinions of my other great men—among them Carlyle, Kant, Mirabeau, and Renan—who believed that the invention of writing formed the real beginning of civilization. These opinions are well supported by the statement so frequently quoted in anthropology: As language distinguishes man from animal, so writing distinguishes civilized man from barbarian.3 As Gelb suggested, the early anthropologists felt the same way. Among them, Lewis Henry Morgan was most influential. In his book, Ancient Society (1877), he argued that European civilization was the apex of human evolutionary achievement. He felt that there were stages of civilization along the way and that oral indigenous societies, with their simple and some- times barbaric lifeways, were going through the necessary stages that would eventually lead them to enlightened, literate cultures. 1 Bruno Latour, “Visualisation and Cognition: Drawing Things Together,” in Knowledge and Society—Studies in the Sociology of Culture Past and Present eds. Elizabeth Long and Henrika Kuklick (Stamford: Jai Press, 1986), 1. 2 Jack Goody & Ian Watt, “The Consequences of Literacy,” Contemporary Studies in Society and History 5, no. 3 (1963). 3 Gelb, A Study of Writing, 221. 215 216 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? In contrast to Plato’s skeptical views of the value of writing, there are those of the Toronto School which included Marshall McLuhan, Harold Innis, Eric Havelock, and more recently, Derrick de Kerckhove. Innis was the first to start thinking about the effects of a medium on communication and his work heavily influenced Marshall McLuhan.4 McLuhan was famous for his dictum “The medium is the message” but he never makes clear in Understanding Media exactly what he means.5 My interpretation is that he was suggesting that the medium of communication can have a great effect but he doesn’t explain how. McLuhan put Media Studies on the map and, for this, is recognized as one of Canada’s great scholars. Derrick de Kerckhove, McLuhan’s successor at the University of Toronto, has an approach very similar to McLuhan’s and has produced some provocative and insightful ideas particularly in his book, The Skin of Culture.6 Eric Havelock was one of the first to consider the value of literacy to thought rather than communication: The alphabet, making available a visualized record which was complete, in place of an acoustic one, abolished the need for memorization and hence for rhythm. . . . The mental energies thus released, by this economy of memory, have probably been extensive, contributing to an immense expansion of knowledge available to the human mind.7 By alphabet, I think he meant what I refer to as exographics—a visual record of what the mind produced on a permanent medium. This visual storage rather than “an acoustic one” economizes on memory but he doesn’t specify exactly how memory is affected. However, I am puzzled by his use of the descriptor “probably,” another indication that he is uncertain about the strength of his argument. In Orality and Literacy, Walter Ong, a student of McLuhan’s, wrote this: . . . without writing, human consciousness cannot achieve its fuller potentials, cannot produce other beautiful and powerful creations. In this sense, orality needs to produce and is destined to produce writing. Literacy, as will be seen, is absolutely necessary for the development not only of science but also of history, philosophy, explicative understanding of literature and of any art, and indeed for the explanation of language (including oral speech) itself. There is hardly an oral culture or a predominantly oral culture left in the world today that is not somehow aware of the vast complex of powers forever inaccessible without literacy.8 4 Harold Innis, The Bias of Communication (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1951). 5 Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (Cambridge: MIT Press (1994 ed), 1964). 6 Derrick de Kerckhove, The Skin of Culture: Investigating the New Electronic Reality (Toronto: Somerville Press, 1995). 7 Eric Havelock, The Literate Revolution in Greece and its Cultural Consequences, (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1982), 87. 8 Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (Methuen & Co, New York, 1982), 14–15. Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? 217 Ong hints that he will explain why literacy is necessary for science, philosophy, etc. (as the phrase “as will be seen” indicates) but his arguments in the remainder of the book are at best superficial. Again, there is no explanation about how literacy achieves these ends. Note, as well, that Ong is suggesting that there are powerful forces that move oral societies to writ- ing (“orality needs to produce and is destined to produce writing”). Ong wrote this at a time when many scholars felt strongly that all societies would eventually achieve literacy, a notion that has led to untold hardship for many oral peoples. Walter Ong, Jacky Goody and Ian Watt, Michael Clanchy, and Rosamond McKitterick document the transition of societies from orality to literacy and, in the process, they suggest that “writing restructures thought” and “writing restructures consciousness.”9 This is termed the strong form of the effects of literacy on cognition. My understanding of the idea is that the very acts of reading and writing enhance our higher-order cognitive function. Somehow our heads are rewired and we get to a higher level of intellectual potential. Again, one of my difficulties with this position is that the mechanism of how this happens is not specified. What is implicit in these analyses is the empirical evidence of “The Great Divide.” More recently there has been a reaction to literacy as the explanation of The Great Divide. In an article entitled “Goody and the Implosion of the Literacy Thesis,” John Halvorsen attached this abstract: In a series of influential books, articles and lectures over the past quarter-century, Jack Goody has probably been the foremost advocate of the ‘literacy thesis’, the principal claim of which is that the development of logical thought (‘syllogistic reasoning’, ‘formal operations’, ‘higher psychological processes’) is dependent on writing, both in theory and in historical fact. The aim of the present critique is to show that there is no inherent relationship between literacy and logic: that the possibilities for such development supposedly afforded uniquely by literacy also exist in non-literate discourse; that such possibilities, in any case, had no evident role in the historical beginnings of logic; that, in short, the ‘cognitive’ claims of the literacy thesis have no substance.10 Ouch! This is harsh criticism indeed. John Baines also wrote a critique.11 In it, he argues that literacy is hardly the cause of the emergence of an advanced, technological civilization. David Olson labels this reaction to the effects of literacy on cognition the Literacy Myth movement. In his book, The World on Paper, Olson titles Chapter 1 “Demythologizing 9 Jack Goody and Ian Watt, “The Consequences of Literacy,” Comparative Studies in Society and History 5, no. 3, (April 1963); Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (New York: Methuen and Co, 1982); Michael Clanchy, From Memory to Written Record: England, 1066–1307 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979); Rosamond McKitterick, The Carolingians and the Written Word, (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1989). 10 John Halverson, “Goody and the Implosion of the Literacy Thesis,” Man, 27, no. 2 (1992), 301. 11 John Baines, “Literacy and Ancient Egyptian Society,” Man, 18, no. 3 (1983). 218 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? Literacy.” He begins by describing six points of the received wisdom on literacy and then, one after another, he documents research that casts doubt on them. I’ll review just one, his fifth: (5) Literacy as an instrument of cultural and scientific development. We take it as going without saying that writing and literacy are in the large part responsible for the rise of distinctively modern modes of thought such as philosophy, science, justice and medicine and conversely that literacy is the enemy of superstition, myth, and magic.12 To counter this, he first argues that the miracle of ancient Greece was largely done with oral discourse. He cites evidence that literacy was quite limited in ancient Greece. He then argues that oral cultures are more than capable of complex modes of thought. Eventually he writes “Consequently, no direct causal links have been established between literacy and cultural development . . .” I’ll have a closer look at this argument later. In this chapter, I’d like to consider the role of literacy in the formation of advanced tech- nological civilizations like ours. It clearly has a role. But that role needs to be clarified. I’ll provide a synthesis, one that depends heavily on Bruno Latour’s position summarized in the chapter’s epigraph. I’ll begin with some important empirical evidence. 11.1 Luria’s Peasants Alexander Luria (1902–1977 CE), the eminent Russian psychologist, did important work in a number of areas. One of these was research among illiterate Russian peasants in the 1940s.13 A sample of these peasants were interviewed with the goal of trying to understand how they thought. Basically, Luria and his interviewers asked straightforward questions on basic West- ern logic, things like categorization and the interpretation of syllogisms. His results consti- tute an extraordinary window on how uneducated, nonliterate people think. Responses to Categorization Questions The first interview reported is with an individual named Ramkat, a thirty-nine-year-old peasant from an outlying district who had rarely been to any of the nearby cities. He was shown a drawing which included pictures of a hammer, saw, log, and hatchet and asked to identify which object was least like the other three. He responded, “They’re all alike. I think all of them have to be here. See, if you’re going to saw, you need a saw, and if you have to split something you need a hatchet. So they’re all needed here.”14 12 David Olson, The World on Paper: The Conceptual and Cognitive Implications of Writing and Reading (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 6. 13 Alexandra Luria, Cognitive Development: Its Cultural and Social Foundations (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1976). 14 Luria, Cognitive Development, 55. Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? 219 Next Ramkat was shown a picture showing three adults and one child. The interviewer suggested to him, “Look, here you have three adults and one child. Now clearly the child doesn’t belong in this group.” Rakmat disagreed, “Oh, but the boy must stay with the others! All three of them are working, you see, and if they have to keep running out to fetch things, they’ll never get the job done, but the boy can do the running for them . . . The boy will learn; that’ll be better, they’ll all be able to work well together.”15 Next, he was shown a picture of three wheels and a pair of pliers. The interviewer argued “Look, here you have three wheels and a pair of pliers. Surely, the pliers and the wheels aren’t alike in any way, are they?” Rakmat again disputed the suggestion: “No, they all fit together. I know the pliers don’t look like the wheels, but you’ll need them if you have to tighten some- thing in the wheels.” The interviewer countered “But you can use one word for the wheels that you can’t use for the pliers—isn’t that so?” and Rakmat responded “Yes, I know that, but you’ve got to have the pliers. You can lift iron with them and it’s heavy, you know.” The interviewer continued to press the point “Still, isn’t it true that you can’t use the same word for both the wheels and the pliers?” and Rakmat responded “Of course you can’t.”16 The interviewer then returned to the picture he began with, the hammer-saw-log-hatchet picture and asked “Which of these could you call by one word?” Rakmat responded “How’s that? If you call all three of them a ‘hammer,’ that won’t be right either.” Basically, Rakmat rejects the use of a general term. Then the experimenter suggests to him “But one fellow picked three things—the hammer, saw, and hatchet—and said they were alike” and Rakmat responded “A saw, hammer, and a hatchet all have to work together. But the log has to be here too!” Again, the experimenter asked “Why do you think he picked the three things and not the log?” and Rakmat responded “Probably he’s got a lot of firewood, but if we’ll be left with- out firewood, we won’t be able to do anything.” The experimenter then counters with “True, but a hammer, a saw, and a hatchet are all tools.” Again, Rakmat rejects the suggestion with “Yes, but even if we have tools, we still need wood—otherwise, we can’t build anything.”17 Next Rakmat was shown drawings of a bird, rifle, dagger, and bullet and asked which was least like the other three. He responded “The swallow doesn’t fit here . . . No . . . this is a rifle. It’s loaded with a bullet and kills the swallow. Then you have to cut the bird up with the dagger, since there’s no other way to do it. What I said about the swallow before is wrong! All these things go together!” Then the experimenter suggested that rifle/dagger/bullet are weapons and that the swallow is not. Rakmat agreed and then the experimenter suggested “So that means these three go together and the swallow doesn’t?” Still Rakmat objected: “No, the bird has to be there too, otherwise, there’ll be nothing to shoot.”18 The problem Rakmat is being asked to do is a classic categorization problem. For us, this is an easy problem. Yet Rakmat clearly does not think as we would. His thinking is 15 Luria, Cognitive Development, 55. 16 Luria, Cognitive Development, 56. 17 Luria, Cognitive Development, 56. 18 Luria, Cognitive Development, 56–57. 220 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? concrete, practical, and based on experience. He is not able to take that abstractive baby step that we do. In addition to Rakmat and the other illiterate peasants, Luria also interviewed some of the younger people who had been to the local schools for one or two years. All were asked the same kind of categorization problem that Rakmat was. The following table summarizes the overall results:19 Group Illiterates Educated Young People #Subjects Correct Categorization? 26 1 12 12 Note that each of the educated young people were able to do the classification but the illit- erates could not. Luria attributed this difference to literacy and the education the younger people had received. Assessments of Similarity As the French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857–1911 CE) noted, judging the similarity of objects is more difficult than judging their dissimilarity. Luria pursued the assessment of the similarity of objects with a number of interviewees but I’ll discuss the responses of just one interviewee because his answers are representative of the others. The subject is Maksud, age 38. He is illiterate. The interviewee began by asking what a chicken and a dog have in common. Maksud responded “They’re not alike. A chicken has two legs, a dog has four. A chicken has wings but a dog doesn’t. A dog has big ears and a chicken’s are small.” Clearly Maksud is not answering the question because he is describing differences rather than similarities. The interviewer then countered “You’ve told me what is different about them. How are they alike?” Maksud then responds “They’re not alike at all.” Again, the interviewer counters “Is there one word you could use for both of them?” and Maksud responds “No, of course not.” Again, the interviewer counters “What word fits both a chicken and a dog?” and Maksud responds “I don’t know.” Finally, the interviewer suggests “Would the word ‘animal’ fit?” and Maksud agrees that it would.20 Next the interviewer begins with a different pair of objects: “What do a fish and a crow have in common?” Maksud responds “A fish—it lives in water. A crow flies. If the fish just lays on top of the water, the crow could peck at it. A crow can eat a fish but a fish can’t eat a crow.” Note again that Maksud makes no effort to identify similarities. Luria then asks “Could you use one word for both of them?” and Maksud responds “If you call them animals, 19 This table is based on Table 7, page 78 of Luria, Cognitive Development. 20 Luria, Cognitive Development, 81–82. Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? 221 that wouldn’t be right. A fish isn’t an animal and a crow isn’t either. A crow can eat a fish but a fish can’t eat a bird. A person can eat a fish but not a crow.”21 Obviously, Maksud had difficulty finding a single word to describe similarity. He was quite unwilling to entertain the fact each of the pairs of words he was given could be described with a single word. But he wasn’t the only one. All interviewees replied in much the same way. Interpretation of Syllogisms I’ll describe what happened with the interviewee Nazir-Said, age 27 and illiterate. He was first presented with this question: There are no camels in Germany. The city of B is in Germany. Are there camels in B? Effectively, he is being asked to complete a syllogism. The first two sentences constitute the premises and, based on these, the interviewee must answer a leading question about the syllogism’s conclusion. The interviewer begins by asking “So are there camels in Germany?” and Nazir-Said responds “I don’t know, I’ve never seen German villages.” At this point the interviewer repeats the original question “Are there camels in Germany?” This time Nazir-Said responds “There are no camels in Germany, are there camels in B or not? So probably there are. If it’s a large city, there should be camels there.” The interviewer then asks “But what do my words suggest?” and Nazir-Said responds “Probably there are. Since there are large cities, there should be camels.” The interviewer then suggests “But if there aren’t any in all of Germany?” and the response is “If it’s a large city, there will be Kazakhs or Kirghiz there.” Again, the interviewer takes exception: “But I’m saying that there are no camels in Germany and this city is in Germany” and the interviewee responds “If this village is in a large city, there is probably no room for camels.” The interviewee does not understand the syllogism and so can’t generate the conclusion. All the other illiterate interviewees had the same trouble.22 Summary Luria’s work is important in helping us understand the effects of literacy and education on thought. It should be clear that peoples untouched by literacy and education think in a much different way. They think in the here, the now, and the practical. It’s what Claude Lévi-Strauss called “the science of the concrete” which he described this way: . . . it is neither the mind of savages nor that of primitive or archaic humanity, but rather mind in its untamed state as distinct from mind cultivated or domesticated for the purpose of yielding a return.23 21 Luria, Cognitive Development, 82. 22 Luria, Cognitive Development, 112. 23 Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Savage Mind (Chicago:: University of Chicago Press, 1962), 219. 222 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? That they think differently doesn’t mean they think poorly and I’ll come back to this point at the end of the chapter. 11.2 The Work of Scribner and Cole About the time Luria’s work was published in the United States, Sylvia Scribner and Michael Cole were able to present data which enabled them to weigh in on the relative importance of education and literacy. In their book The Psychology of Literacy, they looked at the Vai people of Liberia.24 At the time of the research, the Vai exhibited various levels of literacy. A substantial number of them were illiterate. There are others who were literate in one or more of three languages: a native Vai script, Arabic learned largely in Qur’anic schools, and English which they learned at Western-style educational institutions. Scriber and Cole real- ized that they had an opportunity to do a direct test of the effects of literacy by comparing the illiterate group with the those who understood the Vai script but had not yet experienced a classroom education. If literacy matters, then it ought to have shown up in the superior per- formance of the uneducated group familiar with the Vai script relative to the illiterate group. Scribner and Cole did the same sort of higher-order cognitive testing that Luria did. I will not describe the complete set of tests. However, I’ll cover two in detail. I’ve selected the clas- sification problem and the syllogistic logic problem because I think they are representative of the higher-order functioning that Scribner and Cole were testing. Classification Survey respondents were shown the 8 cards shown at the top of this figure:25 24 Sylvia Scribner and Michael Cole, The Psychology of Literacy (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981). 25 Scribner and Cole, The Psychology of Literacy, 119. Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? 223 Each of these 8 cards has one of two shapes (circles or triangles), a number of a particular shape (1 or 2), and a colour (shaded or not shaded). Survey respondents were asked to iden- tify as many of these three dimensions as they could. Note in the figure that, below the 8 cards, the three possible classifications are shown. The one on the left is partitioned on shape (circles on the left, triangles on the right). The middle is partitioned by number (1 on the left, 2 on the right). And the one on the right is according to colour (shaded on the left, unshaded on the right). The experimenter first displayed the 8 cards to the respondent in a random arrangement and then asked “Here are eight cards and I want you to pick out four that are alike in some way.”26 The experimenter then allowed the respondent as much time as required to put the cards in two piles. If the respondent was able to come to two groups based on one of the three dimensions (shape, number, colour), the experimenter would point to one of the groups and ask the respondent to describe how they were the same, and then point to the second group and ask how they were different. If the respondent was successful in identifying a dimension, the experimenter asked him or her to identify a second dimension. If the respondent produced the same dimen- sion, the experimenter would point out that it had already been identified and then asked the respondent to continue trying to find another way to partition the cards. If the respondent was unsuccessful two times in succession, the experimenter arranged the cards according to another dimension, pointed at four of the cards arranged according to that dimension and then asked the respondent to describe how the cards were the same. Once the exchange was finished for a second dimension, the experiment proceeded to the third asking the respondent to identify another way the cards could be partitioned. The procedure for this third dimension was the same as the second. If the respondent could not come to a partition according to the last dimension, the experimenter put them into two groups according to that dimension, pointed to one of the groups of four and asked the respondent to describe how they were the same. The experimenters made three measurements of performance: the number of dimen- sions classified prior to obtaining assistance (maximum of 3); whether number or form was ever used to classify (1 or 0); and the adequacy of explanations summed over successful classifications (these explanations were scored on a 5-point scale with no explanation getting 0 points, a perfect explanation getting 4 points, and an ambiguous explanation getting one of the integer values 1–3). 26 Scribner and Cole, The Psychology of Literacy, 298. 224 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? I’ve reproduced a part of their results table (Table A8.1, page 300): Performance Measures Nonliterate (453) Arabic Monoliterate (36) Vai Monoliterate (53) Vai/Arabic Biliterate (44) English Schooled (53) #Dimensions Identified (max = 3) 1.6 2.0 2.0 1.9 1.7 Number or Form Identified (max = 2) 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.4 1.2 Verbal Explanation Adequacy (max = 12) 5.3 5.8 5.1 5.6 5.6 Scribner and Cole did not publish sample variances with these sample averages so it’s not possi- ble to assess pairwise tests of statistical significance. However, they do remark that there are no significant differences in any performance measure for any pair of literacy types. Most impor- tantly, there is no significant difference in the performance of the non-literates and the Vai monoliterates. At least on this survey question, literacy does not matter. Logic As Luria had with the Russian peasants, Scribner and Cole included a survey question on syllogisms. Each respondent had to answer 6 questions based on these six syllogisms: All the schools in Vai area are built in towns. The government is building a school in Vai area. Is this school built in a town? All houses in Liberia are made of iron. My friend has a house in Liberia. Is my friend’s house make of iron? All people who own houses pay house tax. Boima does not pay a house tax. Does Boima own a house? All women who live in Monrovia are married. Kemu is not married. Does Kemu live in Monrovia? All government officials are wealthy. All wealthy men are powerful. Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? 225 Are some government officials powerful? Some of the people we know are not in school. All the people we know are in Liberia. Are all of the people in Liberia in school? For three of these syllogisms, a respondent could answer correctly just on the basis of local knowledge rather than on the internal structure of the syllogism. The first is an example of this. So it was important to ask respondents how they reasoned their answer. The instruction given to each respondent was “I have some questions to ask you. These questions can be answered yes or no. To answer them all you have to do is to listen carefully to the words and assume that they are true.”27 Subsequent to answering yes or no, the respon- dent was asked to explain his or her answer. Empirical reasons were assigned a score of 0 and theoretical reasons, 1. Importantly, the questions were weighted so that counterfactual problems carried more weight. If a respondent answered all syllogisms correctly giving theo- retical reasons, he or she was assigned a score of 10. The following table28 gives the average scores for each literacy group on both parts of this question: #Correct (max = 6) Nonliterate 1.6 #Theoretical Justifications (max = 10) 6.1 5.7 6.2 5.7 7.6 Arabic Monoliterate Vai Monoliterate Vai-Arabic Biliterate English Schooled 1.3 1.7 1.5 3.0 Again, note that there is no statistical difference between the scores of the Nonliterate and Vai Monoliterate. But what is statistically significant is the English Schooled and all other literacy categories. Synthesis Prior to the work of Scribner and Cole, the idea that literacy induced salutary internal cogni- tive effects was supported by a number of scholars including Jack Goody, Walter Ong, Eric Havelock, and Marshall McLuhan.29 But these scholars offered no direct evidence of these internal benefits. Then Scriber and Cole presented their empirical evidence supporting the 27 Scribner and Cole, The Psychology of Literacy, 305. 28 Scribner and Cole, The Psychology of Literacy, Table A8.4, page 306. 29 See Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (New York: Routledge, 1982); Eric Havelock, Preface to Plato (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1953); and Marshall McLuhan, The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962). 226 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? explanation of education rather than literacy. Patricia Greenfield summarized the impor- tance of their work with this: “[it] should rid us once and for all of the ethnocentric and arro- gant view that a single technology suffices to create in its users a distinct, let alone superior, set of cognitive processes.”30 A number of scholars have weighed in since with the same view as Greenfield.31 But none of these scholars were aware of the idea of embodied thought and, in particular, the notion that exographics could extend our ability to discover A Class ideas without any great modification of our internal cognition. The only thing required was that we be capa- ble of learning the exographics technology. As many cross-cultural studies have indicated, including Luria’s, the children of an oral society are certainly capable of literacy. 11.3 Synthesis The argument I developed over the opening chapters of the book begins with the observation that, to take full advantage of our imaginations, we need an exographics technology. This enables us to make relatively complex arguments in the A Class. I argue that the A Class is now a vast collection of ideas that are at the heart of an advanced, literate civilization. The A Class is cumulative (the ratchet effect) and some ideas still in use go right back to Sumerians some 5,000 years ago. To emphasize the point, let me return to David Olson’s argument which I discussed ear- lier in the chapter. One element of his argument is that most of the ancient Greek contribution was done with oral discourse. Yes, the ancient Greeks were strong believers in the dialectic, but a lot of their work required more than minds in discourse. For example, consider the last paragraph of Chapter 2 of Aristotle’s Prior Analytics: First then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. If no B is A, neither can any A be B. For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B. But if every B is A then some A is B. For if no A were B, then no B could be A. But we assumed that every B is A. Similarly too, if the premise is particular. For if some B is A, then some of the As must be B. For if none were, then no B would be A. But if some B is not A, there is no necessity that some of the As should not be B; e. g. let B stand for animal and A for man. Not every animal is a man; but every man is an animal. 30 Patricia Greenfield, “Review of ‘The psychology of literacy’ by Sylvia Scribner and Michael Cole,” Harvard Educational Review 53, no. 2 (1983), 219. 31 See for example: Diederick Raven, “How Not to Explain the Great Divide,” Social Science Information 30, no. 3 (2001); Brian Street, “A Critical Look at Walter Ong and the ‘Great Divide’” Chapter 7 in Social Literacies: Critical Approaches to Literacy in Development, Ethnography and Education (London: Taylor and Francis, 1995); and Chapter 2 in David Olson, The World on Paper: The Conceptual and Cognitive Implications of Writing and Reading (Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1994). Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? 227 I submit that it would be difficult to do this logic in your mind alone, much less write a complete book with many parts of this complexity. Personally, I needed exographics to work through this passage to make sure I understood it. I’m not sure Aristotle, as good as he was, would have been able to construct this argument in his head alone. Or let’s consider Proposition 47 from Euclid’s Elements I: Proposition 47: In right-angled triangles the square from the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares from the sides containing the right angle. Z H A Q K BG DLE This is the Pythagorean Theorem and, to prove it, he starts his argument by referring to the diagram. The right angle is at vertex A. In broad terms, his proof is to show that the area of box AHZB plus the area of box AQKG is equal to the area of box BGED. I reckon it would be impossible to do the proof without exographics. Just working up the diagram in your unas- sisted working memory would be a feat. Then you have to think through the constructions (the lines to add) and subsequently you need to argue the details of the proof. As for Greek literature, we know that, after the Greeks perfected their alphabet, there was an explosion in their literature including the works of the major philosophers. Before the alphabet, Homer’s epics were the extent of it. After the alphabet came along, the volume grew exponentially. In summary, the contribution of the ancient Greeks is stunning and a substantial part of it was done with exographics. No doubt they used the dialectic to sort through ideas just as we do. However, most of these ideas, many of which form our intellectual heritage, required exographics. Considering Olsen’s point that oral cultures are capable of complex thought, they are. But it’s C Class ideation, not A Class. © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company 228 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? I’ll now try to argue the following proposition: A necessary condition for a society to get to an advanced technological trajectory is their adoption and use of an exographics system. Let me first explain what I mean. The histories of the invention of exographics in various societies are remarkably similar. A society begins to live a fixed-settlement existence based on some economic activity or underlying resource. In Mesopotamia, it was agriculture. This develops into an exchange economy which gets large enough that the state bureaucracy must begin to use exographics to manage it. These initial systems tended to be simple labels and inscriptions. In Mesopotamia, our best guess is that the early token system morphed into a simple prototypical cuneiform which in turn evolved into full-blown cuneiform capable of representing spoken language. It’s also clear that Mesopotamian scribal schools arose because of the necessity of training future generations of administrators in whatever exographics system was in use. It was these scribal administrators and teachers who then began to make advances in the A Class includ- ing those in mathematics, science, law, and literature. These achievements didn’t occur in a flurry but rather over millennia. The first exographics systems were intimately related to measurement. As we’ve seen, these early societies developed increasingly complex number systems that enabled increasingly sophisticated measurement. An “advanced technological trajectory” is one where we see a civilization become increasingly complex, literate, and technological. For example, in Mesopotamia, the early fixed settlements grew into large, flourishing city-states characterized by significant prog- ress in A Class ideation. The term “necessary condition” means that there is no guarantee that a society embrac- ing exographics will ever make any significant A Class contribution. In other words, an exographics system is necessary but not sufficient for that society to make A Class contribu- tions. Some observers have argued that there was no Chinese scientific revolution after their discovery of moveable type and the printing press some four centuries before we did in the West and they offer this as a counterexample to Goody. But it’s not a counterexample to my proposition. What’s more, the Chinese eventually got to science! It took time. But they got there and now make significant contributions to the A Class, as the number of Nobel Laure- ates of Chinese descent attests. Let’s now consider the cognitive abilities of oral indigenous peoples and those of an advanced literate culture. As we saw earlier, there is strong evidence that our imaginations have been developing for a long time. Most of the early evidence is our manufacture of stone tools. We started to do this about 2.5 million years ago and, as time passed, we made increasingly sophisticated stone tools, some with fairly complex production processes. Other evidence includes making jewelry, the act of burial, sculpting small statues, and cave art. All of these activities are indicative of minds imagining what could be and then making that future happen. Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? 229 Leibenberg’s description of persistence hunting is entirely consistent with a good imagi- nation. A hunter has to interpret tracks and other information to deduce the intentions of the prey animal. Whether it’s the animal’s intentions or conceptualizing electricity as electron flow, we employ our imaginations. You can even see this with Luria’s illiterate peasants. Even though we would answer the questions asked much differently, the peasants were com- ing up with interesting explanations that clearly made sense to them. As the psychologist Lev Vygotsky would explain, their imaginations were informed by a mind that had been accultur- ated in a much different way.32 Is there any sense that a mind formed in an advanced literate society has higher cognitive function than one formed in an indigenous society? Walter Ong thought this: Their [non-literate people] thought processes . . . differ from ours not because they are “savage” or “inferior” but because they are what the oral economy of managing language and thought demands. Oral peoples can have a high intelligence and can be very wise. They are what we ourselves are like apart from the support of the writing that has penetrated our psyches so deeply that we can never entirely separate it from ourselves.33 This is consistent with the positions of Bruno Latour and Claude Lévi-Strauss noted above. Based on the C Class ideation of indigenous societies, I believe those in indigenous oral soci- eties have the same cognitive potential we do. Let me now argue the role of education. All societies must ensure there is a transfer of cultural knowledge to the next generation. In many indigenous societies, children and young adults learn the lifeways of their society largely in a learn-by-doing approach. For example, when judged old enough, a male will go out on the hunt to learn how it’s done, and as illus- trated above with persistence hunting, there is a lot to learn. In contrast, children in advanced literate societies go through a formal literate education program largely outside the family. In the West, we spend enormous amounts of time and money on this program. This came into clear focus for me one day walking in Paris. If you leave the front of the Pantheon, walk over to the Rue St Jacques, and then look down to the Seine, you can see the expanse of the Sor- bonne on the left side of the street and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Collège de France on the right. It’s a thoroughly stunning and captivating sight. For a bunch of city blocks toward the river, there is education infrastructure to your left and right. Over the centuries, we’ve invested heavily in education. This enables our young people to function in a highly literate society, and for some, to discover new ideas on the frontiers of the A Class. Whether it’s an indigenous primitive society or an advanced literate society, there is a societal process in place to make sure that the next generation gets the requisite cultural knowledge. 32 Lev Vygotsky, Mind in Society: Development of Higher Psychological Processes (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978). 33 Walter Ong, “Orality-Literacy Studies and the Unity of the Human Race,” Oral Tradition 2, no. 1 (1987), 375. 230 Chapter 11 Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”? It should be clear from the history of education, back to the scribal schools in Mesopo- tamia, that these schools only existed because exographics existed. Certainly that argument applies today. Had we not come to exographics, there would be no need for the massive liter- ate education system we have today. Let me summarize in this way. Literacy scholars in the beginning (McLuhan, Ong, and especially Goody) saw literacy as the explanation of the “The Great Divide.” Their evidence was The Great Divide itself which is clearly a circular argument. After research by Scribner and Cole suggested that the logico-empirical mindset of the West was explained, not be lit- eracy, but rather by education, Literacy Myth scholars took the position that literacy had a minimal role to play in explaining The Great Divide. I think it’s safe to say that literacy and modern education in an advanced industrial society are linked symbiotically. One can’t have education (as we know it) without exographics and education is required to get a subset of our societies to the edges of the A Class. So, the essence of the story is this: first we invented exographics and then the expediencies of cultural knowledge transfer to the next generation required that we set up exographics schools. It was primarily in these educational systems that A Class ideation blossomed. The schools were needed not just for training in the use of the exographic system, but also for teaching students the corpus of A Class knowledge that was accumulating. What is certainly clear is that, without the discovery of exographics, we’d be living the C Class lifeways of an oral indigenous society. I think it’s fair to say that both sides of the debate were correct. Goody, Ong, et al. were correct that literacy explained the Great Divide but really didn’t offer a good reason why. Those opposing (Olson et al.) failed to see that a literate education system only exists because literacy exists! If we hadn’t invented writing and literacy, there would be no need for the mas- sive literate education system we have. On this basis, I submit that there is a strong argument that human imagination supported by literacy and education explains The Great Divide.","length":42586,"tokens":9729,"chunks":[{"title":"Does Exographics Explain “The Great Divide”?","content":"No “new man” suddenly emerged sometime in the sixteenth century, and there are no mutants with larger brains working inside modern laboratories who can think differently from the rest of us.1 Bruno Latour The anthropologist, Jack Goody, used the phrase “The Great Divide” to refer to the differ- ence between industrialized societies and indigenous societies.2 Those of us who live in a modern industrial economy certainly experience a different way of life than, say, the Senti- nelese, who inhabit North Sentinel Island off the coast of India and are virtually untouched by civilization.

The mental energies thus released, by this economy of memory, have probably been extensive, contributing to an immense expansion of knowledge available to the human mind.7 By alphabet, I think he meant what I refer to as exographics—a visual record of what the mind produced on a permanent medium.

I’ll now try to argue the following proposition: A necessary condition for a society to get to an advanced technological trajectory is their adoption and use of an exographics system. Let me first explain what I mean. The histories of the invention of exographics in various societies are remarkably similar. A society begins to live a fixed-settlement existence based on some economic activity or underlying resource. In Mesopotamia, it was agriculture. This develops into an exchange economy which gets large enough that the state bureaucracy must begin to use exographics to manage it.

It was these scribal administrators and teachers who then began to make advances in the A Class includ- ing those in mathematics, science, law, and literature. These achievements didn’t occur in a flurry but rather over millennia. The first exographics systems were intimately related to measurement.

All societies must ensure there is a transfer of cultural knowledge to the next generation. In many indigenous societies, children and young adults learn the lifeways of their society largely in a learn-by-doing approach.

Stephen Hawking We know the Sun and planets formed from the dust of burnt-out stars about 4.5 billion years ago. Once formed, the Earth had a molten surface and, at best, a poisonous atmosphere. Darwin’s theory of evolution suggests a tree-like structure for life but one of the great unan- swered questions of modern science is how this tree took root. What were the first forms of life on Earth? That’s a puzzle we’ve yet to solve. Fortunately, life did begin and, flashing forward to today, we have a species, homo sapiens, which is quite different than the rest. We’re sentient in a different way than all other species. With our hands, we’ve been able to make tools, clothes, etc. and have settled the planet. Now we’re trying to set out on a different path. We’re studying ourselves with a view to understanding why we’re so smart. Once we get that figured out, we’re going to try to build machines that will be a better version of ourselves, ones that will be able to do all we can and more. The philosopher Nick Bostrom has defined the term superintelligence to be “any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest.”1 In principle, we ought to be able to do it. We’re basically protoplasmic machines that are the product of billions of years of evolution. Nature has enabled our minds (and hands) to do some pretty interesting things. I believe this is a very laudable goal and that we should continue to work towards it. It’s also a very difficult problem. I’ll argue below that there are a couple of other research programs that may be as worthwhile and should be pursued. 1 Nick Bostrom, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 22. 231 232 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 12.1 Some History In his Politics, Aristotle makes reference to the equivalent of artificial intelligence: And so, in the arrangement of the family, a slave is a living possession, and property a number of such instruments; and the servant is himself an instrument which takes precedence of all other instruments. For if every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will of others, like the statues of Daedalus, or the tripods of Hephaestus, which, says the poet, “of their own accord entered the assembly of the Gods;” if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves.2 By way of explanation, the statues of Daedalus are those of the sculptor Daedalus and because they were so real, people thought they should be tied down so they couldn’t run away. The poet he refers to is Homer and the tripods of Hephaestus is a self-propelled bowl raised on three legs each with a golden wheel and, as Homer suggested, it wheeled itself to where the gods assembled to serve them. Aristotle is conjecturing the possibility of some artificial intelligence in the future. In Greek mythology, the Titan god Prometheus fashioned humans from clay. In the 19th century, Mary Shelley (1797–1851 CE) wrote Frankenstein. Modern science fiction and the movies have given us the idea of a cyborg. A machine better than us would have to demonstrate more than just the ability to carry on an intelligible conversation. It also wouldn’t be enough to paint like Turner, sculpt like Michelangelo, design like Gaudí, compose like Mozart, play like Perlman, write like Dickens, sing like Beyonce, or think like Aristotle, Newton, Darwin, and Madame Curie. It would have to be better. I. J. Good suggested this machine would be capable of building machines better than itself: Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an “intelligence explosion,” and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.3 2 Aristotle, Politics, trans. Benjamin Jowett (Kitchener: Batoche Books, 1999), 7. 3 I. J. Good, “Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine,” in Advances in Computers, Volume 6, eds. Franz Alt and Morris Rubinoff (Cambridge: Academic Press, 1965), 33. Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 233 When Good refers to an explosion, what he means is that these ultraintelligent machines would build successively more intelligent machines, one after the other, and this would lead to an intelligence explosion, sometimes referred to as “The Singularity.” Many have commented on this idea including the philosopher David Chalmers: If there is a singularity, it will be one of the most important events in the history of the planet. An intelligence explosion has enormous potential benefits: a cure for all known diseases, an end to poverty, extraordinary scientific advances, and much more. It also has enormous potential dangers: an end to the human race, an arms race of warring machines, the power to destroy the planet.4 Others have expressed similar concerns including Elon Musk and Bill Gates. They see these “Singularity” machines as having two characteristics: each generation of machine is better than the previous, and one of these generations is likely to be hostile and wipe us out. 12.2 Getting to Big Ideas As I have already documented, the A Class is now quite large and, by definition, it’s the result of our imaginations and our discovery and use of the exographics technology. In this section, I’d like to step back and examine what it took for some of our great thinkers to get to their big ideas. It seems to me that if we are to build a machine capable of human intelligence, then we need to understand how human intelligence works. I don’t propose to give a complete answer here because we don’t yet know enough. However, we can tease out some characteristics of human thinking that ought to be present in our machines. Alan Turing During World War II, German messages were broadcast via morse code. Allied listening posts could hear these broadcasts so it was important for the Germans to be able to encrypt their messages. They did so with a machine called Enigma. It was a complex piece of machin- ery whose multiple settings changed daily. At the website https://cryptii. com/pipes/enigma-machine, you can encrypt messages using Enigma. You start with the message you want to send, fix the settings, and this will produce the encrypted message to send. For example, I typed in the message: “Allies will land at Normandy” With the settings I had fixed, the message came back “iknrv vrsha tqkis ngyyc yzai” This encrypted message would then be broadcast. At the other end, a unit hearing the mes- sage would plug the day’s agreed settings into their Enigma, type in the encrypted code, and get back the original message. 4 David Chalmers, “The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis,” Journal of Consciousness Studies 17, no. 9–10 (2010), 10. 234 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? I experimented with the original message by changing one of the settings and the encrypted code came back “nvxtp gjlkg ohxlq deaob beyw” which is quite different than the original message. I tried one more setting change and got this encryption “vhqup lmhgg xoavq iqpeh bejo” and again, it’s very different than the previous two. Early in the 1930s, Polish codebreakers had the idea of building a machine to help decode Enigma messages. This machine, which they termed “bomba,” was very helpful but as the Germans built increasingly complex Enigma models, new machines were required. With the fall of Poland early in the war, the problem of codebreaking fell to the British who set up their codebreaking organization at Bletchley Park, north of London. At the height of the war, in 1944, over 10,000 people worked there. It was at Bletchley Park that Alan Turing (1912–1954 CE) and another mathematician, Gordon Welchman, built another machine, the “Bombe,” to help with the decoding. The Bombe was designed to determine what the Enigma settings were on a particular day. It was a large electro-mechanical machine made of very specialized machine parts, and hap- pily, it produced settings quickly most of the time. Once the day’s settings were produced, some 3,000 to 5,000 German messages were decoded daily and sent out to the various com- mands. One of these on D-Day read “Immediate readiness. There are indications that the invasion has begun.” The development and operation of the Bombe has been estimated to have reduced the length of World War II by as much as two years. The savings in lives and property damage were inestimable. Let’s put this accomplishment in perspective: Point1. Theidearequiredextensivemind-sharing. ThecapabilitytodecodeGermanmes- sages during World War II was certainly an A Class idea. This capability was not the work of Turing and Welchman alone, but rather the entire 10,000-person Bletchley Park organization. They built on the shoulders of Polish codebreakers in their efforts to decode Enigma messages prior to the war. This was a team effort. Yes, Turing’s work was criti- cal but, without the complete team, no message would have been decoded. Consequently, the requirement to get to this idea was many bodies and extensive mind-sharing. More recently, think of the mind-sharing that went into producing the iPad, smartphone, and Large Hadron Collider. Point 2. The work of this group was embodied. There was extensive interaction of the think- ers with their environment through their senses and their hands. Let’s just consider Turing. Much of his work at Bletchley Park was in the confines of his small office working with his imagination using pen and paper. This was diaconatic work with periods of bodily action (writing) interspersed within intense periods of thinking. It’s clear that, Turing had to engage the outside world with his eyes and hands to do the work he did. Consider the scene in the movie The Imitation Game where Turing has the final thought that gets them to their first Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 235 decoded message. In a dialectical conversation with his colleagues, it becomes apparent to Turing that the Germans sent out weather updates at 6 a. m. every morning and each mes- sage begins with the word “Weather” and ends with “Heil Hitler” or as it is phrased in the movie by Hugh Alexander, “Heil bloody Hitler.” Turing immediately ran out and over to the building where the Bombe was housed, with the rest furiously following. When he got to the Bombe room, he emptied a bunch of messages on the floor and looked for weather report messages. When these were found, he went to the Bombe and started adjusting it, using his hands and eyes to make the adjustments required. Then the Bombe is turned on; the group stares at it as cylinders turn and the machine chugs away. Eventually it stops and Turing reads off the Enigma settings the Bombe has produced. The group then ran over to another build- ing where a captured Enigma machine sat. They furiously plugged in the settings the Bombe had produced and then began to work on a message which eventually translates into readable German. Enigma was broken! Most importantly, the work required diaconatic thinkers to engage their bodies with the real world. Point 3. The minds of Turing and Welchman were socially constructed. Both experienced a blue-chip British education. Turing went to King’s College, Cambridge, and studied math- ematics. He later went to Princeton for doctoral work, graduating in 1938. He made fun- damental contributions to mathematics and computer science before ever walking on the grounds of Bletchley Park. When the war opened, Turing’s mind was prepared for the chal- lenge he was about to encounter. This brings me to the point. How can we build a machine that is capable of this idea? It seems to me you need at least a team of machines. For the moment, let’s talk about a machine capable of just Turing’s work. Such a machine would have to have vision and be able to process that visual input the way Turing did. It would have to have functional hands. Importantly, it would have to have a set of algorithms that would enable it to move, think, and behave as Turing did. It would have to be a cyborg with a substantial intelligence capable of generating A Class ideas. To do the work of the group at Bletchley Park, we’d need an army of highly intelligent cyborgs. The point here is that you have to understand how human social and individual intel- ligences work. If we think a superintelligent machine is a computer that hums and purrs in a corner, we’re mistaken. A superintelligence has to come from a group of machines that can interact physically with the world and each other. The Wright Brothers The Wright Brothers were no different than Turing. They had to do a long series of experi- ments with gliders and prototypical flying machines to figure out the principles of flight. This is a diaconatic, physical interaction with their environment. There is no way that a cyborg, however clever, could sit at a kitchen table and figure out what the Wrights did. It would have to be a group of them capable of symbolic thought and interacting with their environments and each other. 236 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? Jack Kilby The computer era started in earnest in the late 1940s and, at this writing, we’ve ideated a stunning collection of technologies, including software technologies that enable us to do some special things. A significant contribution along the way was Jack Kilby’s discovery of the integrated circuit. We know that he had a blue-chip education and read everything he could. No doubt he was aware of Geoffrey Dummer’s thinking. Dummer was a British electrical engineer. In a paper delivered in 1952, wrote: “With the advent of the transistor and the work on semi-conductors generally, it now seems possible to envisage electronic equipment in a solid block with no connecting wires.”5 We know that he had to get permission from his supervisor at Texas Instruments to spend the money to put his prototype together. He then ordered in his parts, went into the lab, and built his prototype. Once he demonstrated in prin- ciple that it could be done, TI decided to invest in it. Is it possible that a cyborg could have come up with the idea of building a circuit with no wires? Once the beginnings of the idea came, would it have the ability/body to go into the lab and build the prototype? Most importantly, would the cyborg have the emotional makeup to overcome the many obstacles and problems that would inevitably arise once the lab work began? Maybe. The point is that, we’re going to have to understand how intelligence (both individual and social) really works. Picasso We know that Picasso spent the better part of nine months thinking, sketching, and working on his masterpiece, Les Demoiselles d’Avignon: 5 https://www. computerhistory. org/siliconengine/all-semiconductor-solid-circuit-is-demonstrated/. OscityShutterstock. com Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 237 Completed in 1907, this is the painting that led to his cubist style and a new direction in modern art, a direction that continued the movement away from a faithful representation of the reality everyone else sees. We know that this painting went through a long gestation period, and by some estimates, a year. Picasso filled 16 sketchbooks and did numerous studies including putting paint to canvas before eventually doing the painting that now hangs in the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York. Miles Unger, in his book Picasso and the Painting That Shocked the World, suggests that Picasso went through an emotionally demanding experience: As it turned out, the process of giving birth to a modernist masterpiece proved more difficult than Picasso had anticipated, pushing him to the limits of physical and emotional endurance and cutting him off from friends who had little comprehension of what he was doing. It consumed him for more than eight months, months of unremitting labor, personal hardship, and spiritual anguish.6 A part of what drove him was his competition with Matisse and his desire to lead the avant- garde that brewed in the bohemian life of turn-of-the-century Montmartre in Paris. The question is whether we can build a cyborg capable of something like this. The ide- ation of this painting was certainly an intellectual achievement. But it was also a significant emotional experience. Will our cyborg “Picassos” have the same depth of feeling and emo- tion that must influence such ground-breaking work? Furthermore, this painting was such a departure, that Picasso, fearing that the painting would not be received well, did not show it for a long time. As it turns out, very few people saw it until it was purchased by the MOMA in 1939. How are we going to load our “Picasso” cyborgs with the right emotions? Summary What does it take to discover a serious root ideas? If alien observers were to describe how these great thinkers worked, they would detail a diaconatic process where each alternated between periods of contemplation (the idea step) and then working with their hands (the action step). They would see that ideas required imagination, social intelligence, and their hands. Ideas are not the result of a thinker sitting in a chair with his or her hands neatly folded. No, ideas are the product of imagination unleashed on a world that gives feedback as the thinker works towards the breakthrough idea. This suggests to me that machines that only do computations, regardless of how sophis- ticated, will not produce a single A Class root idea. More to the point, if we are to replicate our ability or even improve on it, we really need to understand the embodied nature of our intelligence. 6 Miles Unger, Picasso and the Painting That Shocked the World (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2017), 318. 238 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 12.3 Deep Learning We’ve built machines that have beaten our best in games of chess, Go, and Jeopardy. The driverless car, is almost operational. We’ve sent probes to Mars that currently send data back to Earth. We’ve built prosthetic hands that have remarkable capability. Let’s have a look at some specific applications in more detail. Our vision algorithms have come a long way. Consider this picture and the problem of identifying what’s in it: A deep learning algorithm designed for this purpose will not only recognize the cat and dog but also that the dog is a Malamute. This picture used to take 20 seconds to process. Now it takes 20 milliseconds. This is all the more remarkable when you consider what the computer starts with. Digi- tal pictures are made up of a large group of pixels, each a very small area where the colour/ shading is uniform over the area. Each pixel’s colour/shading is represented by a number. So the picture above can be represented by a large grid of numbers. A very small section of it might look like this: All image classification algorithms begin with large grids of such numbers and then try to make sense of them. Ermolaev AlexanderShutterstock. com Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 239 A Deep Learning approach basically takes a large number of pictures for which the content of each is known and, from this data, it learns how to recognize what is in pictures for which it doesn’t know the content. Once this training is done, the algorithm is applied to other pictures to see how well it does at identifying what is in each picture. Such process- ing on large datasets has been made possible by the significant improvements in computer processing power. Our image processing has now been extended to video files which are sequences of image files. This processing is now good enough that we are using it in self-driving cars where it’s important to classify correctly. While introducing apps for computers to speak with humans, at the 2018 Google I/O conference, Google CEO Sundar Pichai gave a demonstration of what Google Assistant can do. The machine was asked to phone a hair salon to make an appointment the following day between 10 a. m. and 12 noon. Pichai played the conversation that had occurred to do this and it was clear that the salon person answering the phone had no idea she was speaking to a machine. The appointment was made successfully and the audience was suitably impressed. So was I.7 However, let’s think about this for a moment. Making a hair appointment is not a difficult cognitive problem. There is a difference between making a hair appointment and arriving at something like the theory of evolution by natural selection. 12.4 Does the Machine Really Understand? These advances in AI are impressive. However, is it the case that the computer really under- stands what is in an image? What comes to mind is John Searle’s Chinese Room argument.8 I won’t go over the details of that argument here, but Searle effectively shows that a computer may be able to behave very intelligently without having anything close to an understanding of that behavior. With the argument, Searle refutes what he calls Strong AI: “. . . the appro- priately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.”9 We can all appreciate that a computer doing image processing doesn’t really understand the content of what it is “looking at” the same way a human does. But we have to be careful about what we mean by “understand.” In tests to compare the ability of humans with those of apps in image recognition, the apps perform marginally better. So at least on image rec- ognition, machine learning algorithms are good and getting better all the time. We have to admit the possibility that our intelligence might be the product of a relatively small number 7 You can see the conversation here: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM&t=155s. 8 John Searle, “Minds, Brains, and Programs,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 3, no. 3 (1980). 9 Searle, “Minds, Brains, and Programs,” 417. 240 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? of hacks just like this image recognition hack. So if we were able to figure out the rest of the hacks, including ones that enable our connection to other human beings and ones that enable movement, particularly with our hands, then we might be getting close to a machine that understands. AI and Machine Generated Prose I’ve already mentioned the benefits of using Grammarly. There are ongoing attempts to have a machine make larger interventions and even do stand-alone writing. One such project is OpenAI’s GPT-2. Here is OpenAI’s description of it: We’ve trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization—all without task- specific training.10 The model is a deep learning neural net whose parameters are set by the input data you give the net to learn with. In one version of GPT-2, OpenAI researchers gave it a huge amount of Internet text as input. With help from GPT-2 experts at OpenAI, the New Yorker writer John Seabrook did an interesting experiment. They trained a GPT-2 net with data from the archive of the New Yorker. The plan was to train the model, give it the first paragraph of a classic New Yorker piece, and then see what prose GPT-2 produced to advance the article. In Seabrook’s words: “. . . could GPT-2 write a New Yorker article?”11 The data for the experiment was all non-fiction articles in the New Yorker since 2007 as well as some classic pieces dating back to the 1960s. The model took less than an hour of computer time to train. Seabrook decided to present GPT-2 with the first paragraph of Lillian Ross’s 1950 piece on Ernest Hemingway: Ernest Hemingway, who may well be the greatest living American novelist and short-story writer, rarely comes to New York. He spends most of his time on a farm, the Finca Vigia, nine miles outside Havana, with his wife, a domestic staff of nine, fifty-two cats, sixteen dogs, a couple of hundred pigeons, and three cows. Here is the second paragraph suggested by GPT-2: I walked up the path to the fence and saw a plump dog, that had been a common visitor to the Finca Vigia before the war, galloping up a path to the main building, 10 https://openai. com/blog/better-language-models/. 11 John Seabrook, “The Next Word: Where Will Predictive Text Take Us?,” The New Yorker, October 14, 2019, available at https://www. newyorker. com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the-new-yorker.

He had a red beard and wore his waistcoat in an overcoat with the body of a ship, three broad belts of colorful chain-link, a pair of capacious rectangular eyeglasses, and a silk tie. “Gouging my eye,” he said, in Italian, saying that he had caused himself that terrible scar, “the surgeon said it wasn’t that bad.” When he was very young, he said, he started smoking but didn’t find it very pleasant. The cigarette burns in his hands and wrists were so bad that he had to have his face covered.13 This makes even less sense. Just consider the last couple of sentences. Why would you be burning your hands and wrists when you started to smoke? Shouldn’t it be the “cigarette burns on his hands” rather than the “cigarette burns in his hands”? And if the burns were on your wrists and hands, why would you have to cover your face? However, both paragraphs sound pretty good! Just as Chomsky’s famous sentence “Col- orless green ideas sleep furiously” sounds good, so do the GPT-2 paragraphs. But when it comes to meaning, narrative, or gist, they fall short. It would be interesting to train a GPT-2 model on all children’s fairy tales minus The Three Little Pigs, then give the trained model this first paragraph: Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. I’d love to see how this story turns out. Towards the end of the article, Seabrook summarized: 12 Seabrook, “The Next Word,” https://www. newyorker. com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the- new-yorker. 13 Seabrook, “The Next Word,” https://www. newyorker. com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the- new-yorker. 242 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? But composing a long discursive narrative, structured in a particular way to advance the story, was, at least for now, completely beyond GPT-2’s predictive capacity.14 That’s a fine summary filled with metaphor. Like Seabrook, I have serious doubts that a machine will ever be able to write such a paragraph, much less a longer narrative that makes sense. It’s my feeling that it will be a long time before a machine can produce a New Yorker article. As I described above, GPT-2 is based on a mathematical model termed a “deep learning neural net.” It would be a mistake to crucify such models on the basis of their performance within GPT-2. They have been remarkably successful in a variety of applications. The self- driving car is a good example. We’re well down this road and the technology appears to be working. However, why the models have worked so well appears to be a mystery to those who use them. Seabrook quotes OpenAI’s chief scientist Ilya Sutskever speaking about the nature of deep learning models: “The stuff is like . . . [pause] . . . It’s like alchemy!”15 Coming back to the point, it’s clear that the GPT-2 algorithm doesn’t understand anything. 12.5 Looking Ahead For those who are skeptical of a superintelligent AI, there have been many instances where we’ve thought something is impossible only to find out shortly afterwards that we were mis- taken. It must have been a shock when folks learned that the Earth was really a giant sphere and not something flat. The concept of a Heliocentric Universe was a shock to 16th cen- tury Europeans. Before Copernicus, people believed all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth. Why wouldn’t they given the evidence they observed every day! Consider the miracle of powered flight. Just eight years before the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, the eminent British scientist Lord Kelvin declared that heavier-than-air flight was impos- sible. When considering the moon shot, how many really thought humans could actually get to the moon? The point is never say never. I still think a cyborg replicating one of us is a long way off. Let’s put this in the context of the Ideasphere. Our species has evolved a wonderful ide- ation ability. Early on, about 2.5 million years ago, we had a number of good ideas but the time between good ideas, like stone tools and cooking, was measured in centuries. Then, 14 Seabrook, “The Next Word,” https://www. newyorker. com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the- new-yorker. 15 Seabrook, “The Next Word,” https://www. newyorker. com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the- new-yorker. Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 243 about 5,000 years ago, we discovered the exographics technology. This opened up the A Class. Admittedly the growth in new ideas quickened a bit, but our perfection of the technol- ogy and our growth in A Class knowledge both occurred slowly. There was steady growth but it was slow growth. Meanwhile, we continued to make progress with C class ideas. We were living in close proximity within cities of expanding size and that’s always good for ide- ation and the transmission of ideas. Once Gutenberg ideated his printing press and moveable type, and Martin Luther pinned his theses to the cathedral door, A Class ideation really began to accelerate. The point is that our discovery of a single technology enabled us to ideate the A Class which, today, is a vast collection of wonderful ideas that have enabled us to live longer, healthier lives in an advanced technological society. What’s more, there does not appear to be any slowing down in this growth. It’s tough to argue that A Class growth will not expand exponentially. Machine learning and AI are certainly a big part of A Class research today. I am going to suggest that we consider another line of research that might also bear some fruit. The Possibility of a Third Class Approximately five millennia ago, we invented the exographics technology largely as an aide-memoire. It was getting increasingly difficult to manage the exchange economies that arose in the fixed settlements based on agriculture. With exographics, ancient accountants and administrators were able to record transactions using clay in various forms (first tokens, then tablets) to serve as the medium of storage. Shortly thereafter, we began to use it to gener- ate A Class ideas. Hence, we developed a technology for one purpose and then redeveloped it for an unrelated use. This leads naturally to an interesting conjecture: Is there a new technology, one dif- ferent than exographics that would enable our imaginations to discover ideas we couldn’t with either our naked imaginations (C Class) or our imaginations supported by exographics (A Class)? Effectively I’m suggesting that the Ideasphere may have another class of ideas we’re able to discover with a technology we’ve either recently invented or have yet to invent. I’m going to label this class the X Class. Let’s first review why exographics are so useful. First, they allow us to reify abstract objects thereby bringing them into our visual field where we are very good at manipulating them. In the construction of an exographic argument, exographics serves two purposes. If we think of any argument as a sequence of statements, exographics serves an aide-memoire purpose by recording the statements as we imagine them. This removes the requirement to put these statements into our permanent memory which is what we must do in the absence of exographics. The second purpose is to record the output of our imaginations as we build the next statement. Based on the most immediate statement(s) and a higher-level outline plan in 244 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? memory, our imagination goes to work to produce the next statement. For example, it could be the next several brushstrokes by an artist, the next line of code by a programmer, or the next line of a novel by an author. In summary, exographics relieves us of the requirement to put an argument into LTM. It also relieves us of the requirement to share the idea orally. As we’ve already discussed, exographics provides a way to share ideas over space and time. Another possibility is a set of technologies that enhances one or more of our senses to see the world in a different way, an enhancement we hope will lead to new ideas which may require exographics to explore fully. In what remains of this chapter, I’ll explore how vision technologies have allowed us to see the world in a way we otherwise couldn’t. 12.6 Extending Our Visual Reach Important Characteristics of Human Vision The human eye can only see objects in a narrow spectrum of light. The following diagram shows a breakdown of the spectrum of light on the right and the part that the human eye picks on the left:16 Note the small band of wavelengths visible to the human eye located between infrared and ultraviolet light. The graphic makes clear that we can only see a narrow band of the com- plete spectrum. There are many animals who see within a larger band. For instance, arctic reindeer can see ultraviolet light. This enables them to see lichens, a major source of their 16 Taken from http://wiki. gis. com/wiki/index. php/Light. udaixShutterstock. com Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 245 calorie intake. The reindeer see lichens as dark patches in the snow. Eagles have much better eyesight that humans. They can detect ultraviolet light but their great advantage is their nerve density in their retinae as well as their ability to hold their heads steady in flight. These two factors give them great eyesight at a distance. Both advantages have evolved to make eagles better hunters. An interesting characteristic of our vision is our tendency to see the whole rather than the parts. This is termed the gestalt principle. To see how it works, consider this example: Note that this picture contains five Pac-Man-type circles on a white background. But the arrangement of these circles on the page leads to us seeing a star. 12.7 Vision Enhancing Technologies Eyeglasses Our attempts to magnify, among other things, words on a page go back at least to the Roman philosopher Seneca who is said to have used a glass globe full of water to read. Subsequently, around 1,000 CE, reading stones were used. These were made of quartz and later glass. Effectively they magnified exographics just as a modern magnifying glass does. The first eyeglasses with frames as we know them today were likely invented by the Italian Salvino D’Armate (1258-1312 CE), about 1285 CE. Since that time, we’ve figured out the science of eyeglasses and the science of vision. Iurii VlasenkoShutterstock. com 246 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? The Telescope Hans Lipperhey (1570–1619 CE) applied for a patent on the first telescope in 1608 CE. Galileo Galilei (1564-1742 CE) made improvements to the basic design and then pointed his at the heavens. When Galileo looked at the moon, he observed its mountainous terrain. Ptolemy’s geo- centric theory held that the heavenly bodies were made of uniform substance and were per- fect spheres. A second discovery was the phases of Venus. Like our Moon, Venus appears at various phases over time. These range from the full phase to the crescent and new phases as shown below: The Sun is the bright small sphere in the middle. The Earth is the sphere at the bottom of the picture. The six spheres in the orbit around the sun represent the phases Venus. Let’s assume, for the purposes of this argument, that it stays stationary. Note that the phases of Venus occur for the same reason the phases of our moon occur: for the “new” and “cres- cent” phases, Venus lies between the Earth and the Sun and the light of the Sun is mostly blocked by Venus; whereas with the “full” phase, Venus is clearly visible because the Sun lies between the Earth and Venus. Another thing to note is the changing size of Venus: at the full phase, when Venus is further away from the Earth, it appears much smaller than it does in the new and crescent phases. For Galileo, the startling conclusion was that Venus and the Earth must follow a circular orbit around the Sun. Galileo’s third observation concerned Jupiter. Previously, Jupiter was seen as just another star. But when Galileo observed it, Jupiter suddenly got much bigger. What was more peculiar were the four additional bodies close to Jupiter that changed their position relative to Jupiter from night to night. Galileo’s conclusion was that these four bodies must be moons that circle Jupiter. © Shutterstock. com Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 247 In 1610, Galileo published his findings in a pamphlet entitled “Sidereus Nuncius,” some- times translated “Starry Messenger.” This is one of the most famous publications in all of sci- ence because its implications were so profound. It shattered the geocentric view, a view that had survived for hundreds of years. In Galileo’s time, the Roman Catholic church espoused the view that man was created and placed on Earth, the center of the universe, and all heav- enly bodies rotated around the Earth (albeit some moved in curious orbits that exhibited epicycles). The moons of Jupiter were direct evidence that not all heavenly bodies orbited the Earth. The phases of Venus posed another problem for the geocentric theory. Needless to say, Galileo’s views were not accepted by the Church and, as is well known, the implications for Galileo were severe. Since the time of Galileo, we’ve built increasingly more powerful telescopes. With the Hubble Space Telescope, we’ve been able to see galaxies 13 billion light-years from the Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope was launched on Christmas Day 2021. It cost $10 billion and promises to help us see much further, far enough to see the formation of the first galaxies. From Lipperhey’s device to the James Webb Space Telescope is a great leap in our ability to see a long distance and deep into our past. Sometimes it takes a lot of ingenuity, data, and machinery to get an important visualiza- tion of something that is far away. To see this, consider this picture: It’s of the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, about 25,000 light-years away. If we were to actually go to the center of the Milky Way and travel from the left edge of this picture to the right edge, it would take about 1,000 years if if we could travel at the speed of light. To put this in perspective, if you were travelling at the speed of light, you could go around the Earth 7.5 times in one second. The volume of real space this picture covers is incomprehensibly large. © I. Haywood/ SARAO. Reprinted by permission. Shutterstock. com 248 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? Now let’s look at what’s in it. One of the researchers involved, Ian Heywood, described it this way: The complex, cirrus-like emission from the Galactic centre super bubble dominates this image. This is traversed by the Radio Arc, a complex of many parallel radio filaments. The radio bubble nestles against the diffuse Sagittarius A region in the lower centre of the image. The bright dot near the centre of this region is Sagittarius A*, a 4 million solar mass black hole. This image captures the chaotic complexity of the very heart of our Galaxy.17 Most galaxies have a black hole at their center and its mass is generally many times larger than the mass of the Sun. In the case of the Milky Way, it’s 4 million times larger. What you see in this picture are galactic events that occurred 25,000 years ago. In effect this is archeo- logical light. It’s 25,000-year-old light captured by the MeerKAT radio telescope. What is happening at the center of the galaxy right now, at this moment, won’t be known for 25,000 years. The MeerKAT radio telescope, located in South Africa and completed in 2017, is cur- rently the most advanced radio telescope of its kind in the world and comprises 64 linked receptors spread over a circular area of diameter 8 kms. Each receptor, with its dish and hous- ing, is about 20 meters tall and weighs 42 tons. When in operation, receptors receive cosmic radiation which is then converted to a numerical data signal and forwarded to a main hub for further processing and storage. The data from this receptor array is then analyzed to produce pictures like the one shown above. For that single picture (and for each of the others produced), 200 hours of telescope time were used to collect 70 terabytes of data. To give you an idea of how much data that is, a single book (60,000 words) is about a megabyte. So, 70 terabytes would be 70 million books. If you could read one of these books in an hour and never sleep, it would take you just under 8,000 years to read all of them. Seventy terabytes is a lot of data! More importantly, it’s clearly impossible to survey the raw numerical data as it sits to get some idea of what you’re seeing. What’s required is an algorithm and two supercomputers to produce the exographic above. The exographic is meaningful. It tells us a little more about ourselves and our place in the universe. But to get it is no small feat. It requires that you throw $330 million at thousands of qualified imaginations. The Microscope Microscopes also extend our visual range. Electron Microscopy allows us to see at the level of individual atoms. For use in biology, it’s not helpful because it tends to fry the living matter 17 Dr. Ian Heywood, taken from the press release at https://www. sarao. ac. za/media-releases/new-meerkat-radio-image- reveals-complex-heart-of-the-milky-way/?fbclid=IwAR1I_aL4j-5b5a6pna1Bq5iJTJK-e-DeO4uYT49_EBGEyG2hiGY- OsdgtQ8k. Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 249 it’s directed at. The 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists for the development of super resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRFM). Because of the phenom- enon of diffraction, normal optical microscopes limit the size of the object we can observe to one 500 nanometers in width. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter. SRFM offers much smaller resolution. We’re now able to observe the action and movement of large proteins within a cell over time. Atom Smashing Machines The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), built at a cost over $7 billion, is enabling us to view the world of the fundamental particles which make up matter. Basically, subatomic particles are accelerated to almost the speed of light and smashed into one another. Scientists then study the data these collisions produce. Recently, it’s output confirmed the existence of the Higgs Boson, a particle whose existence was suggested in the theoretical work of physicist Peter Higgs over fifty years ago. MRI and Xray Machines An MRI machine enables doctors to generate information about the internal state of a patient’s body. The same is true of an Xray machine. “Going There” Machines Sometimes, it’s preferable to actually go somewhere to see for oneself. For example, Darwin travelled to the Galapagos Islands. There he was able to observe interesting morphological differences in the same species living on different islands. This enabled him to enhance his knowledge of natural history and eventually to start thinking about the variation in species. In 1977, the US launched two unmanned space probes, Voyager I and Voyager II, to observe the planets in the outer solar system. The pictures these two vehicles have sent back to Earth have been stunning. The InSight Mars probe was launched in May 2018 and landed on Mars in November 2018. It’s designed to study the deep interior of Mars. There are a large number of upcoming “going there” missions planned. A NASA website reports 20 missions scheduled for 2022 alone.18 One mission is Janus. The plan is to launch two vehicles which will travel to the Main Asteroid Belt between Jupiter and Mars. They are to image two binary asteroids.19 Data Visualization The analysis of data is important in science. Sometimes it’s essential to be able to look at a “picture” of the data. For example, suppose we think there is a relationship between the 18 https://nssdc. gsfc. nasa. gov/planetary/upcoming. html. 19 A binary asteroid is a large asteroid with a small asteroid orbiting it. 250 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? variables x and y. In an experiment, we fix the value of x and then observe the value of y that results. Suppose this yields the following dataset: xy 1.1 0.41 1.9 1.19 2.6 2.24 3.2 3.42 Just looking at this data, we can see that as x increases, y also increases. But we may wish to determine whether there is a mathematical relationship between x and y. It’s not clear what form that relationship should take. One way to get an idea is to visualize the data on a Car- tesian plane: 4 3 2 1 0 It would appear the data is consistent with a nonlinear function. One could then attempt to fit a number of nonlinear functional forms using regression analysis. The point is, without this visualization, it would be difficult to know what functional form to try. This technique of picturing functions and data in the Cartesian plane goes back to the pioneering work of René Descartes (1596–1650 CE). In the analysis of data, Descartes’s idea of representing it on a plane with two parallel axes was a great leap forward. With it, we had a way to link algebra and geometry. William Playfair (1759–1823 CE), a Scottish engineer, is generally considered the father of statistical graphics. He invented a number of different types of charts including pie charts and bar charts. Edward Tufte, the American statistician, is a modern pioneer in the field of data visualization. His books on visualization are seminal. 0123 x © Dr. W J HurleyShutterstock. com y Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? 251 Simulation and Virtual Reality Technologies These are technologies which allow us to “see” alternative realities, a skill at the heart of our imaginations. Simulation has been used for a long time to train pilots. Pilots climb into simulators which then present them with standard and emergency situations to deal with. They hone their skills and teamwork with this practice and this has obvious benefits. Let’s consider architecture. Traditionally architects communicate their vision to a client with two-dimensional plans and sometimes scaled three-dimensional models of the struc- ture. With virtual reality, architects can now put a headset on a client and have the person walk through the structure to see what it will look like from inside. Virtual reality is now being used to train surgeons. Rather than practise on cadavers, a surgeon will strap on a headset and handsets and run through a simulated operation. It’s fairly straightforward to simulate a manufacturing process to see how changing it might make it more efficient. Most of these simulations show an animation of the physical movement of labour and materials through the process to see how alterations can enhance throughput and/or reduce bottlenecks. Clearly, a mathematical model of any real-world phenomenon is a simulation of reality. For instance, suppose we are looking at a machine with an operator and, for costing and pric- ing purposes, we are wondering how long it will take the operator to finish 360 units. Based on past data, we estimate that the time to do x units is T = 30 + 1.2x (measured in minutes) where x is the run size. Then for 360 units, the time required is T = 30 + 1.2(360) = 462 min- utes. Here the model T = 30 + 1.2x is an approximation of reality. The actual cost of a run size of 360 units might be slightly different from 462 for a variety of reasons. 12.8 Summary The book’s main argument is that the technology of exographics has opened up a massive class of ideas including those which give rise to the modern artifacts and gadgets of our techno-literate societies. In this chapter I asked whether there is another technology or set of technologies, pos- sibly undiscovered, that will give rise to a new class of ideas, one I term the X Class. I think there is and speculate that it might be technologies which enable us to see things we other- wise couldn’t. I also pointed out that the path to great root ideas is embodied. It’s not enough to build a suite of supercomputers and let them go. Like the Wright Brothers, whatever this superintel- ligent machine is, it will have to engage with the world to figure out how the world works. Such a superintelligent machine would have to run experiments, make measurements, and most importantly, use its imagination to determine what to do next. In short, it has to be able to create and appreciate metaphor.","length":50869,"tokens":11472,"chunks":[{"title":"Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence?","content":"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race    It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate.

It seems to me that if we are to build a machine capable of human intelligence, then we need to understand how human intelligence works.

With the fall of Poland early in the war, the problem of codebreaking fell to the British who set up their codebreaking organization at Bletchley Park, north of London. At the height of the war, in 1944, over 10,000 people worked there. It was at Bletchley Park that Alan Turing (1912–1954 CE) and another mathematician, Gordon Welchman, built another machine, the “Bombe,” to help with the decoding.

More recently, think of the mind-sharing that went into producing the iPad, smartphone, and Large Hadron Collider. Point 2. The work of this group was embodied.

The group then ran over to another build- ing where a captured Enigma machine sat. They furiously plugged in the settings the Bombe had produced and then began to work on a message which eventually translates into readable German. Enigma was broken!

Ideas are not the result of a thinker sitting in a chair with his or her hands neatly folded. No, ideas are the product of imagination unleashed on a world that gives feedback as the thinker works towards the breakthrough idea.

Meanwhile, we continued to make progress with C class ideas. We were living in close proximity within cities of expanding size and that’s always good for ide- ation and the transmission of ideas.

The second purpose is to record the output of our imaginations as we build the next statement. Based on the most immediate statement(s) and a higher-level outline plan in 244 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence? memory, our imagination goes to work to produce the next statement.

The first eyeglasses with frames as we know them today were likely invented by the Italian Salvino D’Armate (1258-1312 CE), about 1285 CE. Since that time, we’ve figured out the science of eyeglasses and the science of vision.","content_length":862,"content_tokens":199,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence?","content":"Iurii VlasenkoShutterstock. com 246 Chapter 12 Will the Next Big Ideas Come from Artificial Intelligence?

Ptolemy’s geo- centric theory held that the heavenly bodies were made of uniform substance and were per- fect spheres. A second discovery was the phases of Venus. Like our Moon, Venus appears at various phases over time. These range from the full phase to the crescent and new phases as shown below: The Sun is the bright small sphere in the middle.

Another thing to note is the changing size of Venus: at the full phase, when Venus is further away from the Earth, it appears much smaller than it does in the new and crescent phases. For Galileo, the startling conclusion was that Venus and the Earth must follow a circular orbit around the Sun. Galileo’s third observation concerned Jupiter.

It shattered the geocentric view, a view that had survived for hundreds of years.

Victor Hugo from Notre-Dame de Paris In Notre-Dame de Paris, Victor Hugo (1802–1885CE) explains the meaning of the iconic statement “This will destroy that”: It was the cry of the prophet who already hears the far-off roar and tumult of emancipated humanity; who, gazing into the future, sees intelligence sapping the foundations of faith, opinion dethroning belief, the world shaking off the yoke of Rome; . . . It signified that one great power was to supplant another great power. It meant, The Printing-Press will destroy the Church.1 Hugo published Notre-Dame de Paris in 1831, post-Enlightenment, post–French Revolution, post–American Revolution. At Jefferson’s urging, the United States had enshrined the prin- ciple of separation of Church and State in the Bill of Rights. Humanism, with its Epicurean roots so alive in the poetry of Lucretius (On the Nature of Things), challenged the tradi- tional hold of the Church. The assault continues today with the work of the New Atheists, a group informally led by Richard Dawkins.2 Belief in something—even the Church of Human Reason—seems to be a part of our DNA. However it’s not really the books that are at issue. It’s the ideas in the books that have given rise to this long march of reason. Ideas are peculiar things. They’re weightless and without volume. Yet some have had the power to change the world. In the mid-19th century, Karl Marx (1818–1883 CE) sat in the British Library and wrote Das Kapital, a critique of capitalism; his ideas have influenced socialist forms of political organization for billions of people for over a century. Adolf Hitler thought that Jews were an inferior race and murdered 6 million of them. Charles Darwin believed that all living things were related and this upset our creation myths considerably. 1 Victor Hugo, Notre-Dame de Paris, Book V, Chapter II, paragraph 3, 1831. 2 Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2006). 253 254 Chapter 13 The Threat of the A Class More particularly, I’m referring to A Class ideas, ideas birthed in the electro-chemical soup of our heads with the help of the exographics technology. While it’s true that ideas have allowed us to develop an advanced techno-literate culture, there are some risks and problems associated with this advance and I’ll detail these in this chapter. 13.1 The Reaction to Serious Ideas Many A Class ideas have aroused strong reactions. Galileo preached the heliocentric uni- verse with the Sun motionless at the center and the Earth revolving around it. For this heresy, the Inquisition sentenced him to house arrest for the remainder of his life. There was a strong reaction to Darwin’s ideas about evolution, particularly by the Church of England. One of the favourite reactions of the opponents of ideas is a good old-fashioned book burning. Wikipedia documents 156 such incidents.3 An example occurred on February 7 (Shrove Tuesday), 1497 CE in the Piazza Della Signoria in Venice. In the center of the piazza, a number of objects were placed on a large pyramidal staircase of eight levels, seven for the seven deadly sins and an eighth level reserved for a picture of Carnival himself. Beards, masks, and the disguises of Carnival, the festival period that ended on Shrove Tuesday, were placed on the lowest step. There were a number of books and manuscripts placed on the second step. On the step above that were a set of female accoutrements including mirrors, veils, and scents. Another level contained paintings of the female form, ones of Lucretia, Cleopatra, Faustina, and others. This collection was set ablaze and burned in a fire known as the Bonfire of the Vanities. This event was the inspiration of the Dominican monk Savonarola (1452–1498 CE), who preached the necessity of ridding society of its temptations. His goal was to return to the fun- damentals of Christianity. On the matter of ancient wisdom and books, the historian Jacob Burckhardt reports Savonarola saying this: The only good thing which we owe to Plato and Aristotle, is that they brought forward many arguments which we can use against the heretics. Yet they and other philosophers are now in Hell. An old woman knows more about the Faith than Plato. It would be good for religion if many books that seem useful were destroyed.4 Savonarola’s program of puritanical renewal did not go well. A year after the burning, he was hanged and burned in Florence. The Library of Alexandria, one of the greatest collections of ancient writing, was dam- aged at least three times. The final act was instigated by the Moslem Caliph Omar. In 640 CE, 3 See https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/List_of_book-burning_incidents#Protagoras’_%22On_the_Gods%22_(by_Athenian_ authorities). 4 Jacob Burckhardt, The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy, trans. Samuel Middlemore (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1914), 250–251. he ordered the contents destroyed because “they will either contradict the Koran, in which case they are heresy, or they will agree with it, so they are superfluous.” The contents were used as tinder in the bathhouses of the city. In 1562 Fray Diego de Landa, the Bishop of Yucatan, burned the codices of the Maya on the basis that they were heretical. There is some dispute about how many were actually burned but we now have very little original work by the Maya. There are only three surviv- ing codices with a fraction of a fourth. Those codices destroyed would have been extremely valuable in our efforts to understand the Mayan culture. 13.2 The Downside of the Technology of Writing Exographics have done great things for us. However like any technology, there are some warts and we need to be mindful of these. Claude Levi-Strauss (1908–2009 CE) argued that literacy arose out of the formation of larger political organizations (settlements, then cities, then states). Along with these organi- zations there is the problem of class and, in some cases, enslavement: “If my hypothesis is correct, the primary function of writing . . . is to facilitate the enslavement of other human beings.’’5 Walter Benjamin (1982–1940 CE) wrote “There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.”6 George Steiner’s (1929–2020 CE) critique is particularly damning: “We know now that a man can read Goethe or Rilke in the evening, that he can play Bach and Schubert, and go to his day’s work at Auschwitz in the morning.”7 Some scholars argue that the Agricultural Revolution wasn’t the bowl of cherries it’s been made out to be. Jared Diamond wrote this: Now archaeology is demolishing another sacred belief: that human history over the past million years has been a long tale of progress. In particular, recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of agriculture, supposedly our most decisive step toward a better life, was in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered.8 What Diamond means is that our proximity to animals led to zoonotic diseases which still plague us. More recently, James Scott has written a fascinating account of the Agricultural Revolution.9 In it, he details the societal ills that came with it. Among these was the signifi- cant servitude of an underclass including slavery. Scott spends some time detailing the role of writing in this exploitation. 5 Claude Levi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques (New York: Atheneum, 1961), 291–292. 6 Walter Benjamin, “On the Concept of History” (1940), available at https://www. marxists. org/reference/archive/ benjamin/1940/history. htm. 7 George Steiner, Language and Silence, Essays 1958-1966 (London: Faber, 1967), ix. 8 Jared Diamond, “The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race,” Discover Magazine, May, 1987, 64. 9 James Scott, Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017). Chapter 13 The Threat of the A Class 255 256 Chapter 13 The Threat of the A Class Closer to the present and to home, I am reminded of the tragedy of the so-called “residen- tial schools” experienced by Canadian indigenous peoples. Between 1870 and 1990, roughly 150,000 Indian, Inuit, and Métis children were taken from their families and placed into resi- dential schools where they were given a traditional Western education, learning to read and write in English rather than their native tongues. The program was an act of cultural genocide designed to assimilate the indigenous population. The death rate among these children was much higher than normal for children that age and many others came out damaged emotionally. Canada is only now starting to come to grips with the enormity of the damage done. 13.3 The Cotton Gin and the Unintended Consequence of A Class Ideation The Saxe Principle suggests that cultural innovation is a matter of local improvement but sometimes these local improvements can have unintended consequences. To see this, let’s consider the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney (1765–1825 CE) in 1794 CE. Whitney grew up on a farm in Massachusetts and, by all accounts, showed a very early interest in tools and a gift for mechanical invention. He graduated from Yale in 1792 and was invited to tutor in South Carolina. He ended up in Georgia at a plantation where he was encouraged to try his hand at an important problem. At the time, cotton was an important cash crop. After being picked, it was necessary to separate the relatively large seed from the usable fibre it produced. This was done by hand. Whitney thought that he could produce a machine to separate the cotton fibre from the seed and worked over the winter of 1793–1794 to produce his cotton gin:10 moc. kcotsretuhSsngiseDKP 10 https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Eli_Whitney#/media/File:Cotton_gin_EWM_2007. jpg. The principle of the gin is that the teeth on the large drum pull the cotton fibres through the slits you see on the left but these same slits do not allow the seeds to go through. Clearly this invention is in the A Class (at a minimum, there was measurement to design, manufac- ture, and fit together the parts). To be sure, this design required paper and a quill pen to think through. A single worker separating cotton from its seeds by hand could produce about 1 pound of fibre a day. A cotton gin (with an operator) could produce about 55 pounds a day. The cotton gin quickly dispersed through the antebellum South and cotton became a substantial cash crop. The following table shows the growth in cotton production and the number of slaves over time: Chapter 13 The Threat of the A Class 257 Year 1800 1820 1840 1860 Production (million lbs) 35 160 834 2280 Cotton Percent of US Exports 7 32 51 57 #Slaves 893,000 1,191,000 2,487,000 3,204,000 As you can see, there was exponential growth in the cotton produced. The third column of the table presents the production of cotton as a percentage of US exports. It went from 7% in 1800 to 57% by 1860. At the same time, the number of slaves increased substantially. Certainly the cotton gin did wonders for the US economy but it categorically didn’t help those who where enslaved to work in the fields. Here we have a case where an A Class inven- tion leads to a very unsatisfactory societal outcome. 13.4 Ultrasociality and the Problems Induced by the A Class Ultrasociality refers to our ability to live in large groups of genetically unrelated individu- als, a behavioral characteristic that only humans seem to have. One of the great unanswered questions in social science is how we’ve managed to do this. We are primates with a deep wiring for inherent primate behaviours. We know that primates live in territorial kin-based groups and that they will defend aggressively any ter- ritorial transgression by unrelated conspecifics. So we’re not really surprised when we see such behavior by humans. Modern urban gangs are an example. If one gang invades another’s territory or seizes it's resources, then there is usually violence to resolve the transgression. 258 Chapter 13 The Threat of the A Class Nation states are capable of severe violence in the face of aggression: it’s been estimated that 70–85 million people perished in World War II. At the other extreme, humans are capable of significant acts of altruism. In the example of World War II, many soldiers volunteered and lost their lives in the fight. There are many examples of charitable giving and volunteering. We give blood and some of us give organs to non-kin. Many modern governments have programs designed to bring up standards of living to a socially acceptable minimum. Even Darwin noted that altruistic behaviour is a conundrum for evolution and natural selection. What would possess a man to help another at great expense to himself? How did we evolve this ability to cooperate in such large non-genetically related groups so quickly? After all, it was only 12,000 years ago that we lived in small kin-based hunter- gatherer groups. Certainly, our recent prosocial activities run counter to the kin-based wiring developed over millions of years. However we have done it. What comes with it is a considerable expansion of the Ideasphere, particularly the A Class. The International Space Station is a marvel of modern technology built by a consortium of countries at a cost of $150 billion. That’s a long way from a small group of hunter-gatherers working for an afternoon to secure dinner. Moreover, it's easy to come up with literally thousands of such mega-project examples where our ultrasoci- ality has expanded the A Class. We’ve been able to set up cultural forms which enable us to contribute to the A Class on a grand scale. Effectively, these forms allow us to exploit a global network of imaginations. When it comes to the A Class, McLuhan’s global village has arrived. Unfortunately, our ability to do A Class ideation has given rise to a number of serious problems: War on an Industrial Scale. We are primates and appear to be wired for tribal and violent behaviour. Think about the 20th century alone. There were two great wars, many bloody smaller conflicts, and a significant number of genocides. The number of dead in World War II alone is estimated to be at least 70 million. We are in possession of nuclear arsenals that could, in the words of Winston Churchill, “make the rubble bounce” many times over. What makes matters worse is the increasing weakness of the international order. With the rise of Trumpism and other forms of nationalism, the world appears to become increasingly com- petitive. Despite this potential for massive bloodlettings, Steven Pinker has argued that, in relative terms, human violence is receding.11 Poisoning the Climate. Scientists generally agree that we are doing untold damage to our climate and that without cooperative action among nations we are headed into the abyss. On the matter of scientific evidence, the reader is referred to the seminal work of Michael Mann 11 Steven Pinker, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (New York: Viking, 2011). et al.12 and a follow-on book by Mann.13 Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth is a documen- tary warning of the effects of greenhouse gases. Biodiversity Loss. As a species, we had a tenuous start in East Africa. However our intelli- gence and prosociality have enabled us to stamp a massive footprint on the planet. The global human population was 7.8 billion in 1970 and, with fertility rates still supporting growth, it’s expected to be 9.9 billion in 2050 (prb. org). Over the last 11,000 years (dating from the begin- ning of the Agricultural Revolution), the biomass of vegetation has been cut by 50%. There has been approximately a 25% loss of animal species over this same period. Vast Inequities in Economic Wealth. There is significant evidence that the rich are getting richer in most countries.14 Thomas Piketty argues that capitalism has a systemic flaw which leads naturally to income inequality and his position is consistent with the evidence.15 By his measurement, we are living in a second Gilded Age where the richest 1% in the US have the same wealth the comparable group had a century ago. But, I think there is a more serious problem. 13.5 The Main Threat Induced by A Class Ideation Before the Agricultural Revolution, we lived in hunter-gatherer societies where there was specialization but not nearly to the extent we have today. Basically, the males hunted and females gathered. As we’ve seen, there was lots of C Class ideation to facilitate this provision of the necessities of life. Basically, our hunter-gatherer ancestors led simple self-sufficient lives. In contrast, our accumulated A Class ideation has resulted in societies where large num- bers are dependent on the society’s cultural system functioning as it should. Most of us have very specialized skills which enable us to participate in a modern techno-literate society. This specialization is largely the result of our A Class ideation. We have constructed finely tuned decentralized societies where each of us plays a very specialized role. This, unfortu- nately, carries with it an attendant risk: if there is a disruption of any significance, there can be significant loss of life. An example is Russian president Vladimir Putin’s 2022 decision to begin a war in Ukraine. This has resulted in high casualties of Ukrainians (civilian and military) and 12 Michael Mann, Raymond Bradley, and Malcolm Hughes, “Northern Hemisphere Temperatures During the Past Millennium: Inferences, Uncertainties, and Limitations,” Geophysical Research Letters 26, no. 6 (1999). 13 Michael Mann, The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines (New York: Columbia Univer- sity Press, 2012). 14 Paul Collier, The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007). 15 Thomas Piketty, Capital in the Twenty-First Century (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014).

The effect on prices may be severe. At this writing, the war appears to be in its initial stages and Putin has intimated that he could employ Russian nuclear arms and chemical weapons. It may get a lot worse. 13.6 Solutions How are we to solve these problems? One class of solutions will rely on our ingenuity. We’ve shown ourselves to be highly innovative in the face of problems. For example, consider the problem of climate change and greenhouse gases. Our techno-literate cultures have a mas- sive appetite for energy and currently fossil fuels provide a good deal of that requirement. Unfortunately, the use of fossil fuels produces a lot of CO2, the primary gas that now forms the “green house effect” with its concomitant increase in global temperatures. One solution is renewable energy and we’re well down this road. This would include technologies based on wind power, hydro-electric power, and solar power. These all have the benefit of no direct carbon footprint, but can they be scaled up? Fusion What is beginning to show significant promise is fusion, the reaction that powers the energy generation in the core of the Sun. The basic physics is that when two nuclei join in a fusion reaction, a tremendous amount of relatively clean energy is produced. The difficulty is that high temperatures are required to enable this reaction. At the core of the Sun, the tempera- ture is about 10 million degrees Celsius and this combined with high gravitational pressure enables the fusion reaction. On Earth, we don’t have the benefit of the Sun’s high gravitational pressure. To get a fusion reaction, we need to heat hydrogen atoms to 100 million degrees Celsius. The technical difficulty is that we don’t have materials that can withstand such high temperatures. One of the possible solutions to this problem is to put super-heated hydrogen plasma (a gas consisting of two hydrogen isotopes) into a donut-shaped magnetic field. The gas circulates and the magnetic field keeps it away from the walls of the chamber. Recently, scientists have experimented with coverings of tungsten and beryllium on the walls of the chamber and these have been able to withstand the heat generated by the fusion reaction. The beauty of fusion is that it produces radioactive materials with a life of only about 100 years which is a lot less than the life of the radioactive waste produced by current fission methods. The difficulty is that the technology needs to be scaled and this is likely to take decades. Consequently, a commercially viable fusion reactor is not likely to be available until the sec- ond half of this century. Hence fusion looks like a good solution but not for a while. Artificial Photosynthesis Another approach that shows promise is trying to replicate how vegetation transforms solar energy into sugars. In the photosynthesis process, plants split water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere; the hydrogen is then used in subsequent reactions. Researchers are currently trying to replicate this process to produce a usable fuel. Like fusion, there are going to have to be technology breakthroughs so this approach, while promising, will not help us for a considerable period of time. The Real Stumbling Block Another approach to our problems is altering societal behaviours. Are we going to be able to cooperate enough, both within and among societies, to make progress on problems like climate change? Solving climate change is substantially different than going to the moon, a cultural act executed within a hierarchy whose managers were able to align behaviour to get the desired result. With climate change, nation states have to cooperate and this has the flavour of the Tragedy of the Commons which argues that farmers grazing their cattle on the Commons (a common area) will all overgraze and in so doing, destroy it.16 The solution of the problem requires farmers to cooperate but, as with the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, each has an incentive to defect. Something like climate change requires cooperative action and political will at a global level and, so far, we haven’t done this very well. According to climate scientists, we are already starting to see the effects of climate change with rising sea levels, flooding, drought, and massive fires. These lead to the disrup- tion of our highly integrated societies. It’s my feeling that we’re on a path that is going to require our ingenuity and cooperation on a massive scale. I think the ingenuity will come. The trick will be whether we can muster the cooperation required. The real stumbling block is us.

Those codices destroyed would have been extremely valuable in our efforts to understand the Mayan culture. 13.2 The Downside of the Technology of Writing Exographics have done great things for us. However like any technology, there are some warts and we need to be mindful of these. Claude Levi-Strauss (1908–2009 CE) argued that literacy arose out of the formation of larger political organizations (settlements, then cities, then states) Along with these organi- zations there is the problem of class and, in some cases, enslavement: “If my hypothesis is correct, the primary function of writing","content_length":1132,"content_tokens":252,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Threat of the A Class","content":"is to facilitate the enslavement of other human beings.’’5 Walter Benjamin (1982–1940 CE) wrote “There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.”6 George Steiner’s (1929–2020 CE) critique is particularly damning: “We know now that a man can read Goethe or Rilke in the evening, that he can play Bach and Schubert, and go to his day’s work at Auschwitz in the morning.”7 Some scholars argue that the Agricultural Revolution wasn’t the bowl of cherries it’s been made out to be.

To see this, let’s consider the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney (1765–1825 CE) in 1794 CE. Whitney grew up on a farm in Massachusetts and, by all accounts, showed a very early interest in tools and a gift for mechanical invention. He graduated from Yale in 1792 and was invited to tutor in South Carolina. He ended up in Georgia at a plantation where he was encouraged to try his hand at an important problem.","content_length":959,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Threat of the A Class","content":"At the time, cotton was an important cash crop. After being picked, it was necessary to separate the relatively large seed from the usable fibre it produced. This was done by hand. Whitney thought that he could produce a machine to separate the cotton fibre from the seed and worked over the winter of 1793–1794 to produce his cotton gin:10 moc. kcotsretuhSsngiseDKP 10 https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Eli_Whitney#/media/File:Cotton_gin_EWM_2007. jpg. The principle of the gin is that the teeth on the large drum pull the cotton fibres through the slits you see on the left but these same slits do not allow the seeds to go through.

A single worker separating cotton from its seeds by hand could produce about 1 pound of fibre a day. A cotton gin (with an operator) could produce about 55 pounds a day. The cotton gin quickly dispersed through the antebellum South and cotton became a substantial cash crop. The following table shows the growth in cotton production and the number of slaves over time: Chapter 13 The Threat of the A Class 257 Year 1800 1820 1840 1860 Production (million lbs) 35 160 834 2280 Cotton Percent of US Exports 7 32 51 57 #Slaves 893,000 1,191,000 2,487,000 3,204,000 As you can see, there was exponential growth in the cotton produced.

One of the great unanswered questions in social science is how we’ve managed to do this. We are primates with a deep wiring for inherent primate behaviours. We know that primates live in territorial kin-based groups and that they will defend aggressively any ter- ritorial transgression by unrelated conspecifics.

At the other extreme, humans are capable of significant acts of altruism. In the example of World War II, many soldiers volunteered and lost their lives in the fight. There are many examples of charitable giving and volunteering. We give blood and some of us give organs to non-kin.

Certainly, our recent prosocial activities run counter to the kin-based wiring developed over millions of years. However we have done it. What comes with it is a considerable expansion of the Ideasphere, particularly the A Class.

With the invention of exographics, we’d expect that A Class ideation would not be too far behind. Consequently, I’ll look at the A Class ideas that arose in these five locales. We don’t know all of the details for how writing was invented in Sumeria but, thankfully, there is a lot of evidence. This is largely due to the fact that the Sumerians wrote on clay tab- lets that were then hardened with baking. There are over 500,000 known tablets and many more remain to be discovered. In the other locations, writing was done on less durable media so we don’t know as much about how it started in these locations. We’ve discussed the role of culture in our evolution. More particularly, we covered our emerging ultrasociality, the phenomenon of living in much larger non-kin groups than we ever 1 Readers interested in this issue might consult the following sources: Steven Chrisomalis, “The Origins and Co-Evolution of Literacy and Numeracy,” in The Cambridge Handbook of Literacy, eds.

We went from small hunter-gatherer groups to the complexity of large urban settlements. In order for us to have been able to do this, we had to have developed cultural practises and institutions which enabled us to cooperate on the scale required by urbanization. One of those cultural practises is writing. To motivate the origins of writing as an aide to memory, I’ll begin with a discussion of how large, complex societies deal with the problem of memory and we’ll see that exographics is an efficient solution to the problem. 14.1 Orality and Memory As we have seen, indigenous societies have a vast ecological knowledge of their native terri- tory. This knowledge is generally developed and maintained by the society as it goes about its daily work. Adolescents, when they take up the work of hunting and gathering, learn by doing. However, there is a store of important community knowledge, knowledge about its history (particularly family history), customs, and values, that is passed from generation to generation in the form of stories, proverbs, and narratives. Think of our society and the important infor- mation that we require children and adolescents to internalize. This transfer occurs at family dinner tables, in schools, in churches, and increasingly across social media. The two groups- indigenous and urban-depend on quite different media to help store important information. Certainly, anthropologists have recognized the considerable abilities that indigenous peo- ples have to remember. For example, during his tour on the Beagle, Charles Darwin arrived at Tierra del Fuego in 1832 and met the inhabitants. In his book, The Voyage of the Beagle, he gave this account: They are excellent mimics: as often as we coughed or yawned, or made any odd motion, they immediately imitated us. Some of our party began to squint and look awry; but one of the young Fuegians (whose whole face was painted black, excepting a white band across his eyes) succeeded in making far more hideous grimaces. They could repeat with perfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them, and they remembered such words for some time. Yet we Europeans all know how difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign language. Which of us, for instance, could follow an American Indian through a sentence of more than three words? All savages appear to possess, to an uncommon degree, this power of mimicry. I was told, almost in the same words, of the same ludicrous habit among the Caffres; the Australians, likewise, have long been notorious for being able to imitate and describe the gait of any man, so that he may be recognized. How can this faculty be explained? Is it a consequence of the more practised habits of perception and keener senses, common to all men in a savage state, as compared with those long civilized?2 2 Charles Darwin, Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of the Countries Visited During the Voyage of the HMS Beagle Round the World (New York: Appleton, 1871), 206. Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 267 The mimetic ability of the Fuegians is stunning. To be able to repeat long English sentences— an unfamiliar language to them—is almost unbelievable. I might be able to repeat one or two Chinese words immediately after they’ve been spoken. But any more and I’d be lost. Rela- tively longer sentences would be impossible. The following account comes from the experience of the Brooke Dynasty (James, Charles and his son Charles Vyner, and Bertram) in Sarawak (a country on the east coast of Borneo) in the 19th century. These men, known as the “White Rajahs” of Sarawak, governed for a century. A part of their experience is documented in the book Ten Years in Sarawak by Charles Brooke.3 In the book, Brooke gives an insightful account of indigenous memory. The situation he documents required that a number of chiefs and their followers pay penal- ties for failure to support the Rajah in a dispute with “enemies on the Sakarang waters.” As described by Brooke, these renegade chiefs “had not assisted us in making the attack on Sun- gie Lang, and who, moreover, had prepared to act against us, if the expedition had not been attended by success. Each country was noted with the chief’s name and number of followers, and an adequate fine, according to Dyak custom, was arranged to be paid as a token of hati baik (good heart).” Brooke then describes his interaction with the Dyak man who would be responsible for collecting the fines. He was expecting the exercise to take three or four days because the man was not literate and could not take notes that might later serve as an aide memoire. But it didn't take long. Brooke described it this way: He brought a few dry leaves, which he tore into pieces; these I exchanged for paper, which served better. He arranged each piece separately on a table, and used his fingers in counting as well, until he reached ten, when he lifted his foot on the table, and took each toe to accord with each bit of paper answering to the name of a village, name of chief, number of followers, and amount of fine; after having finished with his toes he returned to his fingers again and when my list was completed, I counted forty-five bits of paper arranged on the table; he then asked me to repeat them once more, which I did, when he went over the pieces, his fingers, and toes as before. “Now,” he said, “this is our kind of letter; you white men read differently to us.” Late in the evening he repeated them all correctly, placing his finger on each paper, and then said, “Now, if I recollect them tomorrow morning it will be all right, so leave these papers on the table;” after which he mixed them all in a heap. The first thing in the morning he and I were at the table, and he proceeded to arrange the papers as on the evening before, and repeated the particulars with complete accuracy; and for nearly a month after, in going round the villages, far in the interior, he never forgot the different amounts.4 3 Charles Brooke, Ten Years in Sarawak (London: Oxford University Press, 1990). 4 Brooke, Ten Years in Sarawak, 139–140. 268 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class This was a remarkable feat. The native was not able to count as we do, knew nothing of writing numbers and words, yet was able to keep track of a significant quantity of numerical information using his fingers, toes, and pieces of paper. Of course, Plato’s warning on what writing would do to memory comes to mind: “If men learn this [writing], it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks.”5 Let’s now look at more examples of ways that members of oral societies remember. Homeostasis in Oral Societies As cultural knowledge expands for an oral people, they often discard aspects of their history that are no longer required. Jack Goody and Ian Watt characterized this feature with the term homeostasis.6 Although oral peoples have an astonishing ability to remember, there seems to be a limit to what they choose to store. Here is one of Goody and Watt’s examples based on the Gonja people and their territory in Ghana.7 This territory came into being when the warrior Ndewura Jakpa conquered it in the mid-17th century. He set up a number of territorial divisions and put one of his sons in charge of each. At the beginning of the 20th century, the British came to be in charge and recorded that there were seven territorial divisions, one for each of Jakpa’s seven sons. Shortly thereafter political disputes forced the transfer of two of these divisions to neighbouring tribes. The British had a record of this transfer but the Gonja, without text, con- tinued to track it using genealogy. Sixty years later, there was a formal recording of the origins and development of the Gonja territory. This written record shows that Jakpa only had five sons and it does not mention the transfer of the two provinces sixty years earlier. In an oral society, history is sometimes what it has to be to serve the collective memory. Another of Goody’s examples has the same flavour.8 The LoDagaa people of northern Ghana have a prayer similar to the “Our Father.” It’s called the “Invocation to the Bagre” and is about a dozen lines long. Based on tapings, Goody observed that individuals rarely said the Invocation the same way twice. Contrast that to our practice of saying the “Our Father” with exactly the same words every time. This should be an easier task for the LoDagaa but reciting an exact copy of their prayer does not seem important to them. The Built-in Mnemonic of Oral Composition In Orality and Literacy, Walter Ong argued that, if the oral composition is to be successful, it must be memorable.9 This is a nice way to make the point that the mnemonic has to be a part of the structure of what is to be internalized. For example, word strings are easier to 5 The Phaedrus. 6 Jack Goody and Ian Watt, “The Consequences of Literacy,” Comparative Studies in Society and History 5, no. 3 (1963). 7 Goody and Watt, “The Consequences of Literacy,” 310. 8 Jack Goody, The Domestication of the Savage Mind (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 27–29. 9 Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (New York: Methuen and Co., 1982). Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 269 remember if they rhyme or have other structures like alliteration, repetition, and assonance. To see this, consider the children’s nursery rhyme Hey, Diddle, Diddle: Hey, diddle, diddle, The cat and the fiddle, The cow jumped over the moon; The little dog laughed To see such sport, And the dish ran away with the spoon. This verse stretches the imagination but it’s easy to remember because of its rhyme and rhythm. These are some of the characteristics that allow rap and hip-hop artists to internal- ize and then improvise their lyrics in performance. I’ve already mentioned the oral-formulaic structure of epics like The Odyssey and The Iliad. Oral societies also store their important wisdom in proverbs and encomiums which have rhythm and sometimes rhyme. In fact, there are vestiges of it in our literate society: Red sky at night, sailors’ delight. Red sky in the morning, sailors warning. 30 days hath September, April, June, and November; when short February’s done, all the rest have 31. Now consider this example of Walter Ong’s. Here are the first five verses of the creation nar- rative in Genesis taken from the Douay version of the Bible published in 1610: In the beginning God created heaven and earth. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters. And God said: Be light made. And light was made. And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness. And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.10 Now compare that version to this one published in the New American Bible in 1970: In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said, ‘Let there be light’, and there was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness. God called the light ‘day’ and the darkness he called ‘night’. Thus evening came, and morning followed—the first day.11 Ong argues that one of the characteristics of a literature that develops out of oral storytelling is an additive style where the narrative is a sequence of events often connected by the word 10 Ong, Orality and Literacy, 1982, 36–37. 11 Ong, Orality and Literacy, 1982, 37. 270 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class “and.” This is called parataxis. The Douay version of Genesis, translated at a time when most people could not read or write, is just that: a sequence of events connected by ten leading “and”s. Contrast that to the New American version written at a time when most people were literate. The parataxis has disappeared in favour of a standard prose style, one familiar to a literate populace. More recently, Andrew Bannister has analyzed the Qur’an.12 Many researchers have tackled the Qur’an’s structure, but Bannister analyzed it using a digital approach. Not sur- prisingly, he finds that the Qur’an displays many of the structures of oral composition found in other oral-formulaic works and this is consistent with the fact that the Qur’an was com- posed in a largely oral setting. The Benefits of Music for Memory When we were young, we learned to recite the alphabet with a song, the familiar ABC song. I still use the song when I find myself trying to determine where precisely a letter lies. This is an example where music helps me to remember. Today, musicians employ a standardized written code for how to play a piece of music. That code incorporates what notes to play, how long to hold each note, and how hard or soft to play various parts of a piece. Absent this code, how is music passed on? One interesting method comes from the early history of the bagpipes. In the West Highlands of Scotland, pipe music was passed on orally using the Canntaireachd system for a considerable period of time before the advent of sheet music. The system is actually a chant (voice) where the letters of the words in the chant correspond to the pipe notes to play and the durations of the chanted letters are the durations to hold the pipe notes.13 This is a clever method to permit music to memory. A player simply had to learn the chant and he or she knew exactly how to play a piece. Australian Aboriginals have used song as a mnemonic for navigation for centuries. These songs, or “songlines,” include references to landmarks both on the earth (waterholes, rock paintings, and boundaries) and in the heavens. This enabled natives to move between points in their territory which, in Australia, can be a great distance from each other. Effectively, the songs were oral maps. Religious Iconography One of the striking things about Gothic churches in Europe is the extent of their iconography consisting of sculpture, paintings, stained glass, and facade adornments. Notre Dame in Paris is a good example. Construction of the cathedral was started in 1163 and completed in 1345. It was operational well before Gutenberg and his printing press brought literacy to the masses 12 Andrew Bannister, An Oral-Formulaic Study of the Qur’an (Plymouth: Lexington Books, 2014). 13 You can see an example—“The Prince’s Salute” played by Michael Grey—at the YouTube address https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=ZCHRQuITwWs&t=38s. Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 271 (approximately 1450). Initially, the majority of parishioners of Notre Dame would have been nonliterate. Hence, the extensive iconography was intended to remind the congregation of their place in the Lord’s creation. These reminders begin as a parishioner entered the front door. There is a sculpture above the center front portico called “The Day of Judgement.” A small part of it shows the Lord with a weigh scale, souls on the weigh scale, and the Devil trying to push a side down. Souls to the right of the Lord would be entering Heaven and those to the left, Hell. Inside the church, there is an extensive collection of sculpture, paintings, and stained glass. If you go outside and around to the side of the cathedral closest to the Seine and look up to the towers, you can see Notre Dame’s famous gargoyles. No doubt these nasty creatures served the same purpose as the sculpture over the front portico—to provide a dire warning to the faithful of the penalty for sinful behaviour. When compared to churches built today, the difference in the quantity of iconography is stunning. Today, it’s been reduced significantly and a part of the explanation is that literacy allows the church to approach believers through text, a much cheaper medium to deliver essentially the same message. Professional Remembrancers The ancient Greeks had a class of administrative officials called mnemones. These were official “remembrancers” and worked with the courts and judges. Their job was to remem- ber the details of a court proceeding (the contestants, the property, the judgement, etc.). By decree, their determinations were binding and final. Even after the introduction of writing and court records, there is evidence that they continued to serve in this authoritative role. Michael Clanchy (1971) mentions this same class of individuals over the period after the Norman conquest (1066) when England began to transform to a literate society.14 In fact some of these positions persist today. The City of London has an official position called “Remembrancer.” His duties are not what they were centuries ago, but they have the flavour of remembering—the modern Remembrancer is the Chief Protocol officer for the City of London and is responsible for official communication between the City of London and the British government. Auditing Clanchy also reports that, in the post-1066 period, financial accounts were checked orally. They would be read aloud and hence the term “auditing” which means “hearing.” Today, accountants check figures visually. Back then, there was a suspicion of this new medium of writing. Accountants were much more comfortable conducting business orally and this continued for centuries. 14 Michael Clanchy, From Memory to Written Record: England 1066–1307 (London: Edward Arnold, 1971). 272 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class Memory Palaces and the Method of Loci Suppose you had to remember the following list of words: beer, picture, mother, field, baseball, chair, stapler, computer. One way is with rote memorization where you just memorize the words with lots of rehearsal. Another is to employ a mnemonic technique. An example is using a sentence where the first letter of each word in the sentence is the same as the first letter of an object you have to remember. For example, suppose you had to memorize the order of the planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Memorizing the sentence “My Very Excited Mother Just Served Us Nine Pies” would give you the order. The logic of the sentence makes the sentence easier to remember than the original list. Still another technique is the Method of Loci which can be traced to the ancient Greeks about 500 BCE and can be found in the instruction manuals of the Roman rhetoricians Cicero and Quintilian.15 The idea is to associate each word with a place located on a walk through a familiar building, or down a familiar street, or some other trip with a sequential set of land- marks you know. Let me construct a narrative to memorize the list at the top of the page. I’ll use my home. Once I get in my front door, there is a table in the front hallway. I’ll imagine that a beer sits on that table and, above the table, there is a picture of my mother. Next, I’ll go to our sitting room just off the front hallway. I’ll call this room my “field of dreams” and, in it, there is a field (ball diamond) with a baseball sitting on home plate. Next, I’ll go past our kitchen and living room and into my first-floor office where I’ll find a chair, stapler, and computer. Once constructed, this narrative makes it easy to remember the words. About two days after I wrote it, I was proofreading it and read the first line of this section (but not the list of words). I then stopped reading and tried to recall the words using my narrative. In a matter of sec- onds, I wrote them down without error. Tally Sticks When I make a payment today, say my taxes, the government and I each have a record that pay- ment was made. My record is the debit in my chequing account. The tax collectors appointed by medieval kings had a similar problem. They had to have a record of what each citizen had paid. In addition, the person paying the tax would like some sort of proof that he had made the payment. A part of the problem was that most of a king’s subjects would have been illiterate so a receipt with a written inscription of the payment details would not have been much good. 15 Excellent histories of the techniques of memorization are those by Frances Yates and Mary Carruthers: Francis Yates, The Art of Memory (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966); Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992). A recent popular book on memorization is Joshua Foer’s Moonwalking with Einstein: the Art and Science of Remembering Everything (New York: The Penguin Press, 2011). Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 273 The solution the tax collectors came up with was the tally stick. Here is an example: These were made of hazelwood or willow, woods that are easy to split and notch. Look at the notches on top of this block. They are all V-shaped and a V typically represented 5. To give a receipt, split the stick along its length with the split running through all of the notches and cutting the stick in two. If you split the stick that way, and each party to the transaction gets one of the two halves, each would have a record of the transaction. If problems arose later, the citizen would have proof of payment. But there is more to it. The tax-collector could bring out his half to determine whether the stick presented by the citizen was actually the other half. If it was, the notches would match up perfectly. In medieval times, there was a fair amount of cheating and counterfeit behaviour so check- ing the two halves in this way resolved that problem. Millions of these tally sticks from Medieval times have been found in England. There is some evidence that the Chinese used tally sticks. William Baxter suggests this: Thanks in part to its central role at the English exchequer, we have abundant evidence of the medieval tally’s use in England. And some references come from further afield. Describing his Chinese trip (1271), Marco Polo tells us that he saw illiterate persons recording their business dealings by notching and splitting sticks “exactly as it is done with our tallies”, i. e. in Venice.16 Tally sticks are another example of the important point made by Merlin Donald and Edwin Hutchins that, over the centuries, we’ve made extensive use of external objects, some we’ve designed, to help us cognitively. In effect, the tally stick takes the place of the written records that a literate society would keep. 14.2 Mesopotamian Contributions to the A Class I have already detailed the invention of exographics in ancient Mesopotamia. Let’s now look at what they were able to contribute to the A Class. 16 William Baxter “Early Accounting: The Tally and Checkerboard,” Accounting Historians Journal 16, no. 2 (1989): 47. © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company 274 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class The Sumerians certainly distinguished themselves with their C Class ideation including the construction of irrigation systems, the mass production of pottery, the invention of the plough, chariot, and textile mills, the mass production of bricks, modern forms of organiza- tion (including cities), and metallurgy (spearheads, chisels, razors). What stands out, though, is their invention of exographics. By 3000 BCE, they had a proto-cuneiform which would then morph into a fully functional cuneiform. An interesting question, then, is what the Sumerians and follow-on Mesopotamian civilizations were able to do with it. My argument in this book is that exographics gives us a way to open up the A Class. Let’s now see what these Mesopotamian civilizations were able to do. Mathematics One of the great contributions of Mesopotamian mathematics is the place-holder number sys- tem. We’ve looked at the body-counting system of the Oksapmin people. They used body part names for their 27 numbers. It’s a clever idea because you are able to take advantage of the natu- ral ordering of the body parts in order to help you do arithmetic. If you want to design a num- ber system with tens of thousands of numbers (in order to support Mesopotamian economic exchange), you need to do it in such a way that you can easily remember the names of numbers and their order. Eleanor Robson reports that a base 60 system was designed sometime towards the end of the third millennium BCE.17 Before that time there were a number of place-holder systems being used depending on what commodity was being measured.18 In our decimal system we use only 10 symbols (0, 1, 2, . . . 9) and some punctuation to repre- sent the real numbers, an uncountably infinite set of numbers. It’s an extraordinary achievement that begins in Mesopotamia. Our number 402 is (4 × 100) + (0 × 10) + (2 × 1). With this system, it’s very easy to see relative number size. For example, 5,261 > 5,258. One thing the Babylonian system did not have was a symbol for 0 so it was difficult to tell whether a writer meant 308 or 38.19 The Babylonians were able to do all four arithmetic operations in sophisticated ways. In our system, to get, say, 13 × 29, we’d use the standard multiplication algorithm we learned in school but, to use it, we’d have to know the simpler products 3 × 2 and 3 × 9. The Babylonians did this product by using a table of squares. They took advantage of the fact that ab5[(a1b)2 2a2 2b2 ]/2. So to get 13 × 29, they would look up the squares of 41, 13, and 29 and then use the formula above to get the answer. In addition to whole numbers, they also had fractions and they could do arithmetic operations on these fractions. 17 Robson, Eleanor, “The Uses of Mathematics in Ancient Iraq, 6000–600 BC,’’ in Mathematics Across Cultures: the His- tory of Non-Western Mathematics, ed. Helaine Selin (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2000). 18 Hans Nissen, Peter Damerow, and Robert Englund, Archaic Bookkeeping: Early Writing and Techniques of Economic Administration in the Ancient Near East, trans P. Larsen. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993). 19 Most of our knowledge of the Mesopotamian mathematics comes from the Old Babylon period from about 1800 BCE to 1600 BCE. There is also a lot of information from the Selecuid Period (312 BCE to 63 BC) and it appears that a symbol for 0 as a place-holder was in use. Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 275 The Babylonians were able to use a crude form of algebra to solve problems. Otto Neugebauer et al. describe the following problem: “The product of two numbers is 60 and their difference is 7. What are the numbers?” 20 Using modern mathematics, the two numbers can be found by solving a quadratic. Based on the cuneiform tablet outlining the problem, the problem statement and solution are in prose. Within that prose, one of the unknowns is called igum and the other, igibum. There are no equations in the solution but rather a set of arithmetic calculations that demonstrate that the Babylonians knew how to solve general quadratics. More generally, the corpus of problems solved with algebra come from scribal school settings and it’s clear that most of these problems would not have application in the real world. The Babylonians used geometry to calculate the exact areas of basic shapes including rectangles, right triangles, and trapezoids. They approximated the area of circle and could also calculate the exact and approximate volumes of irregular basic shapes, although some- times their approximate solutions erred substantially. Historians have attributed Pythagorean Triplets to the ancient Greek philosopher Pythag- oras.21 However, one of the most famous Babylonian artifacts, the tablet Plimpton 322 held at Columbia University, suggests the Babylonians new about them as early as 1800 BCE, long before the time of Pythagoras.22 With exographics, the Mesopotamian civilizations were able to do high-level mathe- matics, a set of ideas squarely in the A Class. The interesting question is where they applied their mathematics. As I have already remarked, the vast preponderance of Mesopotamian tablets that we know about deals with the ongoing administration of these complex societ- ies. As I’ve already described, these tablets documented the willingness of these peoples to measure just about everything. I have argued that our modern advanced societies are based on literacy and a lot of measurement. That was certainly true of the Mesopotamian civiliza- tions. The early temple complexes in Uruk and Susa were at the heart of developing urban centers. With close management, temple administrators were able to generate substantial wealth and power. This is well documented in the seminal work of Hans Nissen, Peter Damerow, and Robert Englund.23 Land management was crucial to the success of these societies. They needed to be able to survey field sizes and, based on this, forecast harvest amounts. Fields were usually long rectangles with the short side bordering an irrigation canal. Sometimes, fields were irregular shapes and area would have to be approximated. Certainly their knowledge of geometry helped to make these calculations. Agricultural labour was closely scrutinized including harvest activities (reaping and threshing), field 20 Otto Neugebauer, Abraham Sachs, and Albrecht Götze, Mathematical Cuneiform Texts (New Haven: American Oriental Society and the American Schools of Oriental Research, 1945). 21 Pythagorean triples are integer values of a, b, and c which satisfy a2 1 b2 5 c2. An example is a 5 3, b 5 4, and c 5 5. 22 Robson, Eleanor, “Words and Pictures: New Light on Plimpton 322,” American Mathematical Monthly 109, no. 2 (Feb 2002). 23 Hans Nissen, Peter Damerow, and Robert Englund, Archaic Bookkeeping. 276 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class preparation (ploughing and harrowing), and maintenance (hoeing and weeding). Estimates would be made of the required yearly labour and, at year-end, these would be compared to the resource actually expended. Labour used in construction was managed in the same way. Interestingly, these cultures were the first to plan construction with architectural dia- grams drawn to scale (exographics!). Estimates of the bricks required were based on vol- ume calculations. All of this constitutes an astonishing advance within the A Class. Literature Any review of the literature the Sumerians produced should begin with a reading of Samuel Noah Kramer’s work. What I’ll write here is largely taken from his book The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character.24 The Sumerians did a lot of writing and we’re fortu- nate to have access to a large body of it. With new discoveries continuing, it is likely that our knowledge will improve. They wrote myths, epic poems, hymns, lamentations, essays, and even texts of disputations. We know that cuneiform was in place by about 3000 BCE but their literature did not begin to appear until about 2500 BCE. One could imagine that, as the scribal schools began to take a more important role, that some professional scribes might have had the inclination to write. The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature is an online library providing some 400 works. Among these is the narrative poem Gilgamesh written about 2100 BCE well before the Greek epics. So, who were these poems written for? In the hymns, the nar (minstrel) is mentioned along with the scribe. Hence the poems may have been performed orally. Their structure included lots of repetition, metaphor, chorus, and refrain. This would certainly be consistent with writing for oral performance. We have seen the importance of story and myth to all cultures including ours. When exo- graphics came along, we had a convenient medium for its composition and, indeed, delivery. As I wrote earlier, writing gave our storytelling a significant boost. Justice From the beginnings of the Neolithic Revolution, we had taken great steps to live in large ultrasocial groups. To do that, we had to invent and refine organizational forms that main- tained some sort of social order. Naturally, one of these is a system of justice. Since it’s impossible to write a set of rules that will govern every future eventuality, you need some way to adjudicate the inevitable disputes. Under their king, Hammurabi, the Babylonians managed to bring most of Mesopotamia under their control. He ruled from 1792 to 1750 BCE. About thirty years into his rule, decided to write a set of rules to govern individual behaviour. This so-called Code of Hammurabi was 24 Samuel Noah Kramer, The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963). Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 277 originally etched into a four-ton piece of diorite (called a stele) that stands 7 feet 5 inches tall. The stele is covered in cuneiform writing save for the relief at the top which has Samas, the Babylonian god of the sun and divine justice, presenting the laws to Hammurabi. As I argued in Chapter 7, the peoples of Mesopotamia were heavily influenced by their interpretation of the gods and particularly, the will of the gods. The laws of the Code are written in vertical lines from top to bottom of the stele. They govern family law, contract law, professional practise, and administrative law. Item 142 deals with family law: If a woman decides she does not like her husband anymore, she must give her reasons. If she is not at fault, but he leaves and neglects her, he shall give her back the dowry. Then she can go back to her father’s house. Item 22 deals with criminal behaviour: If a man is a brigand (member of a gang of robbers) and attacks people who are traveling, he shall be put to death. Item 2 is an interesting law which required trial by ordeal: If a man accuses a man of sorcery and cannot prove it, the accused shall go to the river and shall throw himself in. If he drowns, he is a sorcerer, and his accuser shall take his house and property. If he is unharmed, the accuser shall be charged with sorcery and be put to death. The innocent man shall also take the house and property of his accuser. The reasoning for this law is based on the Babylonian belief in the gods and their divine will. If the accused survived the ordeal, then it was surely the case that gods were looking out for an innocent man. Items 196 and 197 are “eye for an eye” laws: If a man destroys the eye of another man, his eye shall be destroyed. If one man breaks another man’s bone, they shall break his bone. Finally, item 229 deals with professional practise: If a builder builds a house and it collapses and kills the owner, the builder shall be put to death. Aggrieved parties could ask for a trial and these were similar to those in modern democ- racies. Evidence would be brought, the judge would determine the facts and then make a decision which was usually in writing. Clearly, the idea of justice, codes of law, and their interpretation by the court systems, are all items in the A Class. Because of the complexity of these societies, it’s difficult to see how a system of justice could run purely in the oral mode with no written records. Orality alone would not work. 278 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class Science In the field of Babylonian astronomy, we must keep in mind the Babylonian belief in the influence of the gods. On the relationship between the heavens and the earth, Samuel Kramer wrote this about Sumerian beliefs: Operating, directing, and supervising this universe, the Sumerian theologian assumed, was a pantheon consisting of a group of living beings, manlike in form but superhuman and immortal, who, though invisible to the mortal eye, guided and controlled the cosmos in accordance with well-laid plans and duly prescribed laws. The great realms of heaven, earth, sea, and air; the major astral bodies, sun moon, and planets; such atmospheric forces as wind, storm, and tempest; and finally, on earth, such natural entities as river, mountain, and plain, such cultural entities as city and state, dike and ditch, field and farm, and even such implements as the pickax, brick mold, and plow—each was deemed to be under the charge of one or another anthropomorphic, but superhuman, being who guided its activities in accordance with established rules and regulations.25 Kramer referred to this paragraph as “axiomatic.” With the gods controlling the movement of celestial bodies, a natural thing to do would be to look for celestial omens. Otto Neugebauer reports a series of texts called Enuma Anu Enlil.26 It consisted of 70 tablets and about 7,000 omens. Neugebauer has estimated that this text developed over a number of centuries and reached its final form about 1000 BCE. Neugebauer reports that the formative stages of Babylonian astronomy occurred over the period 1800 BCE to 400 BCE. After 400 BCE, things really picked up speed. They mapped the heavens, plotted the movements of the sun, moon, and planets, predicted celestial events like eclipses, and worked out a 12-month calendar based on these celestial movements. Many of our numerical measures of time are based on those base 60 measures (6o minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute) developed by the Babylonians. Interestingly, Neugebauer suggested that our understanding of Babylonian astronomy is still in its infancy. He felt there were more tablets on the topic and that these needed to be studied by mathematicians. Recently, Mathieu Ossendrijner has translated a British Museum tablet and discovered that the Babylonians were getting Jupiter’s position from the area under a time-velocity graph and that is just one step away from the calculus.27 What’s more, it’s a sophisticated development that couldn’t be done without exographics and measurement. Regarding medicine, there are documents that listed diagnoses, argued the importance of taking a patient’s medical history, recommended medicines to deal with illnesses, explained 25 Kramer, The Sumerians, 113–114. 26 Neugebauer, Otto, The Exact Sciences in Antiquity (New York: Dover Publications, 1969), 101. 27 Mathieu Ossendrijner, “Ancient Babylonian Astronomers Calculated Jupiter’s Position from the Area Under a Time- Velocity Graph.” Science 351, no. 6272 (Jan 2016). Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 279 surgical techniques including how to set broken bones. In preparation for surgery, doctors would wash their hands. I’m not sure that exographics would have been an advantage in medical ideation, but it would have been useful to educate future physicians. There is a famous Babylonian document called the Kikkuli Text which explains how to train horses for use in war. It’s 1,080 lines on four tablets written in Hittite cuneiform. It was inscribed around 1300 BCE and is thought to be a copy of the original written about 200 years earlier. It begins “Thus [speaks] Kikkuli, the horse trainer from the land Mit- tani.” The document is an extremely detailed training program that runs over 184 days. Instructions are given on the horse’s diet, its training program (an interval training of running and cantering), and special treatment in the stables (massages and blankets). Each day is mapped out from morning to midnight. Interestingly Dr Ann Nyland trained some Arabian horses over a seven-month period between 1991 and 1992 following exactly the regime Kikkuli prescribed. She found that his methods were, in certain respects, superior to modern methods. Here is a case where exographics are used to pass on a complex pro- cess to others. Obviously, we don’t know how Kikkuli came to his process. It might have been that he did careful experiments to arrive at this method. Certainly, that would have required him to keep track of exactly what he did with each set of horses in order to know what was best. 14.3 The Role of Exographics in Ancient Egypt About 5,000 years ago, the geographic conditions along the Nile were remarkably similar to those along the Tigris and Euphrates. Not surprisingly, we observe the same sort of fixed settlement based largely on agriculture. One of the difficulties with research on ancient Egypt is that the archeological record is not nearly as detailed as it is for Mesopotamia. In Mesopotamia, a large number of clay-fired tablets have survived to the present. On the other hand, the ancient Egyptians wrote with ink on papyrus, a form of paper made from the stem of the papyrus plant plentiful along the Nile delta. Unfortunately, once formed into papyrus paper and written on, this paper needs to stay dry in order to keep. With the regular flooding along the Nile, many papyrus documents have been lost to us forever. Ilona Regulski reports that the earliest evidence of phonetic writing appears about 3250 BCE.28 These were largely inscriptions found in tombs at Umm el-Qa’ab/Abydos and at Saqqara. This writing tends to be short snippets of an administrative nature. Phonetic full sentences do not appear until 2690 BCE, about five centuries later. What is clear is that the initial writing did not represent spoken language. This is remarkably similar to the story in Mesopotamia where the early writing in Uruk was protocuneiform of an administrative nature. 28 Ilona Regulski, “The Origins and Early Development of Writing in Egypt,” Oxford Handbooks Online, Online Publica- tion Date: May 2016, DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935413.013.61. 280 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class There have been arguments made in the literature that Mesopotamian writing diffused to Egypt. However, the current thinking is that, at best, the Egyptians were influenced by the idea and then went ahead and originated their own system. Let’s now look briefly at the ancient Egyptian contributions to the A Class. Mathematics I would term the Egyptian number system a decimal tally system and it’s worth having a look at in order to make a point about representational efficiency. Their system worked as follows. There was a symbol for each power of 10 as shown in this table:29 That is, 1 is simply a vertical line, 10 is the sign ∩, 100 is a coiled rope, and so on. The Egyp- tian number for our 465 is: Note that, right to left, we have the five 1s, then six 10s, and finally four 100s. Their number for our 280 is: Starting on the right, it’s eight 10s and then two 100s. So, in principle, it’s very easy to rep- resent numbers and it’s also easy to do the four arithmetic operations. But relative to our placeholder system, it’s symbol intense. 29 I am grateful to be able to use the site https://www. dcode. fr/egyptian-numerals which translates our decimal numbers to the ancient Egyptian system.

Two of the more famous sources are the Rhind Papyrus (about 1650 BCE) and the Mos- cow (Golenishchev) Papyrus (about 1700 BCE). Each lists a set of problems. Here are a couple of algebra problems from the Rhind: Problem 24. Find the heep if the heep and a seventh of the heep is 19. Problem 63. 700 loaves are to be divided among four people according to the proportions 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4. There are also some geometry problems. The Rhind Papyrus gives solutions but not the underlying reasoning. For instance, for the problems above, each is solved with a sequence of arithmetic calculations. As with the Mesopotamians, there is no general solution, one that could be applied to all instances of a problem or even to solve new problems. It could be that scribes taught their students these general solutions but they’re not mentioned on the Rhind itself. In the Moscow Papyrus, one of the problems is to get the volume of a frustum (a pyramid with the top cut off; the cut is parallel to the floor of the pyramid). Another asks for the sur- face area of a Quonset hut which has a half cylinder shape. Science The Egyptians made contributions to astronomy, metallurgy, and medicine. These are out- lined by George Sarton.30 Literature There is a significant volume of ancient Egyptian literature as suggested by Miriam Lich- theim’s three-volume anthology.31 The third volume includes texts translated from both hiero- glyphs (the traditional script) and the Demotic (the vernacular script). Lichtheim argues that the Demotic contribution is the more innovative literature. Synthesis With ancient Egypt, we have—again—a largely urbanized population engaged in an agricul- tural economy managed by administrators. Exographics was invented to serve as a memory aide for these administrators. With time (measured in centuries), the scribes make a substan- tial contribution to the A Class. 30 George Sarton, Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece (New York, Dover Publications, 1952). 31 Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume I, The Old and Middle Kingdoms (Oakland: University of California Press, 1973); Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume II, The New Kingdom (Oakland: University of California Press, 1976); and Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings, Vol. III: The Late Period (Oakland: University of California Press, 1980). 282 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 14.4 The Mayan Experience The Maya settled in Central America about 2600 BCE and their Classical Period ran from 250 CE to 950 CE. They lived in large city-states, some with as many as 100,000 inhabitants (Palenque). As with the other early civilizations we’ve looked at, their economies centered around agriculture. The primary crops were maize, beans, and squash. Travel between settle- ments was either by canoe or carefully constructed roadways. They had no beasts of burden so goods were generally transported by canoe or on the backs of slaves. Mayan architecture and art is astonishing. They built many stone temples with some reaching a height of 100 feet. A Class Contributions The Mayans had a writing system consisting of glyphs that were either symbols for an actual word or a representation for the sound of a syllable. Unfortunately, our knowledge of their writing is limited because we are only in possession of a few of their codices (books). In the 16th century, their Spanish conquerors burned most of their documents as they were declared by clergy to be “the work of the devil.” In addition to the codices, scholars can also study inscriptions left on buildings, monuments, walls, and pottery. Great progress has been made decoding the Mayan script but, unfortunately, the destruction of the codex corpus does not leave us much information explaining how their society actually functioned. They had a base-20 number system similar in function to the Mesopotamian base-60 system. Each of the first 19 numbers were presented with dots (each worth 1) and horizontal lines (each worth 5). So the symbol for 13 is: To represent the number 413, they used: Numbers were read from the bottom to the top. Here, the bottom number is 13. Interestingly, the middle number, a picture of a shell, is 0. And the number on the top is 1. Hence, we could represent this number [1;0;13] and, in our decimal system, it’s 13202 10320113315413. Source: © Dr. W J Hurley Source: © Dr. W J Hurley Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 283 We know that the Maya did addition and subtraction with this number system. However, there is no evidence they did multiplication or division but these two operations are certainly possible as Lambert et al. demonstrate.32 This is a sophisticated number system likely used for administrative purposes. Since we don’t have any of their writings, we can’t really say for sure. What we do know is that the Maya used this number system extensively in the three calendar systems they used. They also did a lot of astronomical calculations including the prediction of lunar and solar eclipses and the cycles of Venus. Their estimate of the length of a year was 365.242036 days whereas, with our modern Gregorian calendar, the estimate is 365.2425. Summary It’s unfortunate we don’t have more of the Mayan writing corpus. It would teach us a lot. We do know they had a complex urban society based on agriculture and, almost surely, they invented an exographics system to help them manage it. This then led to contributions to the A Class. 14.5 The Ancient Indus Civilization This civilization flourished about the same time as the Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures and was located on the alluvial flood plains of the Indus River in Pakistan. The settlement pattern here is similar to those in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Excavations at Mehrgarh suggest that its inhabitants were farming (mainly sheep, goats, wheat, and barley) as early as 7000 BCE. By 5500 BCE, they started making pottery, figu- rines, and other crafts and, by 3500 BCE, they were trading with other settlements. About this time, the settlement at Harappa began to become prominent and eventually it developed a large urban center. Agriculture remained the preeminent activity. The Harappans accomplished a lot. Their city planning was advanced. Rather than wind- ing roads, the streets were laid out in a grid structure. Most houses had their own water sup- ply. Inhabitants could shower and waste water was drained away in trenches to the Indus. We have the same difficulty studying the Harrapans as we do with the Mayans. They had a script but with so few samples of it, we've yet to decipher it despite many attempts.33 Over 400 script elements have been identified. Here is a representative subset:34 32 Joseph B. Lambert, Barbara Ownbey-McLaughlin, and Charles D. McLaughlin, “Maya Arithmetic,” American Scientist 68 (1980). 33 A good overview of the symbol set can be found in the paper: Nisha Yadav and M. N. Vahia, “Indus Script: A Study of Its Sign Design,” SCRIPTA 3 (June 2011). 34 Yadav and Vahia, “Indus Script,” 5. 284 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class It looks to be some sort of pictographic syllabary, but there is nothing like the Rosetta Stone that enables us to decipher it. These symbols were found most often in seals (likely used to stamp clay tablets signifying some sort of quantity and ownership). According to Yadav and Vahia, the average number of symbols on a seal is 5, so it is likely that they have some sort of administrative purpose. The Harappans employed weights and measures. Their weights were in the ratios 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500. This combination of seals marked with symbols and weights suggests that Harappans might have been at the stage of starting to keep track of goods with some sort of archaic accounting system much as was used in ancient Mesopotamia. Archeologists have discovered some sophisticated devices for measuring length. One is the so-called “Mohenjodaro Ruler” whose subdivisions were 1.32 inches (the “Indus inch”) with a maximum error of just 0.005 inches.35 It’s difficult to say much more about the Harappans. Certainly they were moving in the right direction. If we were able to translate their script, I think we’d find they were travelling 35 I.

Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class 285 the same path as the other civilizations: urbanization, then exchange management with writ- ing, and then the use of writing to make contributions to the A Class. 14.6 The Chinese Experience It appears that the Chinese came to writing during the Shang Dynasty (1600–1050 BCE). Again, we have very little evidence because they did most of their writing on strips of bamboo and silk and these would have decomposed. Our information comes from inscriptions on bones and other artifacts. From these inscriptions we’ve been able to piece together quite a bit. The inscriptions seem to have been largely for divination purposes. The king would ask “Will I have a son?” or “Will my army be victorious?” What the inscriptions make clear is that the Shang Dynasty were engaged in conflict quite a bit. Some inscriptions suggest that armies of 13,000 men were sent on a campaign. Others speak of bringing back 30,000 pris- oners of war who would then be used for slave labour or sacrifice. As with the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations, the Chinese worshipped their gods and also believed that their dead ancestors could influence the gods. Unlike the other civilizations, it appears that they did not go through a proto-writing stage where their exographics supported economic exchange. Apparently, Chinese writing came out fully formed and it hasn’t changed much since. Based on this and the fact that there was a healthy trade with the Middle East, some scholars have suggested that writing “dif- fused” to China. We know that the Shang Dynasty had a large bureaucracy. It would be surprising if writ- ing was not used to support some elements of this bureaucracy. We do know the Chinese have contributed substantially to the A Class since. What we’re uncertain about is how quickly they did this after writing was discovered. 14.7 Synthesis The story among these civilizations who ideated writing suggests that, with the possible excep- tion of the Chinese, writing originated largely to help administrators manage the exchange in large, urbanized settlements based on agriculture. In most cases, it soon morphed from short administrative notations to fully fledged writing where the exographic marks represented the underlying language. Where we have a lot of information (Mesopotamia, Egypt), A Class ideation followed the introduction of writing typically with advances in mathematics and measurement. These civilizations certainly added to science and literature. The other notable aspect of the cultural achievements of these civilizations was their architecture and arts (painting, sculpture). Their cities, temples, monuments were stunning achievements. In summary, these peoples were highly creative and exographics contributed substantially to their achievements. 286 Chapter 14 The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class We have yet to say much about the training of the scribal class and their place in the hierarchy of their civilizations. These were the individuals charged with administrative tasks requiring exographics. To support this class, there were scribal schools where young students would be trained in exographics and related skills. While we don’t have a lot of informa- tion, this scribal class was a very low percentage of the population, usually no more than 1 percent. Hence the vast majority of the general population would have been illiterate. I suspect that there would have been very little time for scribes to work on A Class ideas. Yet they were able to make stunning advances. Let’s now put this into perspective. In Part I of the book, I argued that exographics allows us to access a set of ideas that would otherwise be undiscoverable. That argument stands on its own and is complete. Consequently, we would expect to see that civilizations who had come to exographics might also contribute to the A Class. There is nothing in the theory that suggests they had to. But it would certainly be interesting if they did. In fact, all of the civilizations that came to writing independently do appear to have generated A Class ideas primarily in mathematics, science, and literature.","length":58902,"tokens":13152,"chunks":[{"title":"The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class","content":"The one crowded space in Father Perry’s house was his bookshelves.

This knowledge is generally developed and maintained by the society as it goes about its daily work. Adolescents, when they take up the work of hunting and gathering, learn by doing. However, there is a store of important community knowledge, knowledge about its history (particularly family history), customs, and values, that is passed from generation to generation in the form of stories, proverbs, and narratives.

He set up a number of territorial divisions and put one of his sons in charge of each. At the beginning of the 20th century, the British came to be in charge and recorded that there were seven territorial divisions, one for each of Jakpa’s seven sons.

Another of Goody’s examples has the same flavour.8 The LoDagaa people of northern Ghana have a prayer similar to the “Our Father.” It’s called the “Invocation to the Bagre” and is about a dozen lines long. Based on tapings, Goody observed that individuals rarely said the Invocation the same way twice. Contrast that to our practice of saying the “Our Father” with exactly the same words every time.

The Benefits of Music for Memory When we were young, we learned to recite the alphabet with a song, the familiar ABC song. I still use the song when I find myself trying to determine where precisely a letter lies. This is an example where music helps me to remember. Today, musicians employ a standardized written code for how to play a piece of music. That code incorporates what notes to play, how long to hold each note, and how hard or soft to play various parts of a piece. Absent this code, how is music passed on? One interesting method comes from the early history of the bagpipes.","content_length":817,"content_tokens":179,"embedding":[]},{"title":"The Discovery of Exographics and the Initial Forays into the A Class","content":"In the West Highlands of Scotland, pipe music was passed on orally using the Canntaireachd system for a considerable period of time before the advent of sheet music.

A player simply had to learn the chant and he or she knew exactly how to play a piece. Australian Aboriginals have used song as a mnemonic for navigation for centuries. These songs, or “songlines,” include references to landmarks both on the earth (waterholes, rock paintings, and boundaries) and in the heavens. This enabled natives to move between points in their territory which, in Australia, can be a great distance from each other.

Professional Remembrancers The ancient Greeks had a class of administrative officials called mnemones. These were official “remembrancers” and worked with the courts and judges. Their job was to remem- ber the details of a court proceeding (the contestants, the property, the judgement, etc.) By decree, their determinations were binding and final. Even after the introduction of writing and court records, there is evidence that they continued to serve in this authoritative role.

The laws of the Code are written in vertical lines from top to bottom of the stele. They govern family law, contract law, professional practise, and administrative law. Item 142 deals with family law: If a woman decides she does not like her husband anymore, she must give her reasons.

Jack Goody and Ian Watt1 In the last chapter, we looked at how the A Class is affected after the invention of exograph- ics by a society. In this chapter, we’ll look at how the exographics technology diffused to the West via Greece and Rome. While ancient Greece and Rome did not invent the technology, they borrowed heavily from other civilizations and made stunning advances in the A Class. The ancient Greeks were the first to use a fully phonetic exographic system and this made their exographics system easy to learn. The Romans also made significant A Class contribu- tions with their phonetic system. 15.1 The Ancient Greeks The Phoenicians This story of exographics begins in Mesopotamia and Egypt and then makes its way to ancient Greece where a significant A Class contribution occurred. A big part of the story of getting the Mesopotamian exographics technology to the Greeks is the Phoenicians (roughly 1100 BCE to 200 BCE) who settled the eastern Mediterranean coast in what is now Lebanon. They primarily organized into city-states; the major ones were Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. The Phoenicians were extraordinary seafaring traders. They were expert ship-builders and navigators. These skills supported their keen mercantile abilities. They built colonies and trad- ing outposts all along the northern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean right to the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage was one such colony. Since they had few natural resources—cedar timber was about it—they relied on trading to support their expansion. They traded timber and a vari- ety of manufactured goods including ships, glassware, pottery, wine, crafts, and a very popular 1 Jack Goody and Ian Watt, “The Consequences of Literacy,” Comparative Studies in Society and History 5, no. 3 (1963). 287 288 Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West purple dye (Tyrian purple) which they derived from a species of snail plentiful in the waters of the eastern Mediterranean. The Phoenicians were exceptional C Class innovators. They had a writing system and number system. As with other civilizations, these systems were used to support city-state administration at first but later were used for other purposes. Again, we run into the archeological difficulty of scant evidence. They wrote largely on papyrus and much of their writing either has not survived or we’ve yet to discover it. What we know comes from what other civilizations have written about them, their inscriptions, and a few written documents. Carolina López-Ruiz suggests that “there was, without a doubt, a Phoenician and Punic literature.”2 She argues persuasively and mentions the Phoenicians making use of writing to come to original ideas in science, to support their system of courts and laws, and to develop a literature. Given what the Phoenicians were able to do in these spheres, I find it hard to believe that they would not have made substantial contributions to the A Class. The Phoenician alphabet, comprising 22 symbols, was an abjad, meaning that it was phonetic but only had letters representing consonant sounds. There were no vowel sounds. As I will argue shortly, such writing systems are easy to learn and, largely for this reason, their exographic system was adopted by many of their trading partners including the Greeks. For this reason, the Phoenicians were crucial to the development of the West. Some Observations on Phonetic Writing Systems We spoke long before we wrote. Language is likely 70,000 to 150,000 years old; we only started to use exographics about 5,000 years ago. Let’s get in the Wayback Machine and return to the time we first started to write. Let’s put ourselves in the place of those folks and think about how we might represent, say, the sun. Were it me, I’d likely represent it with a picture, something like this: This is called a pictographic approach and, as I’ve already documented, a lot of the first scripts were pictographic. The idea is to take what you see and represent it as a picture. It seems so natural to represent what you see. Now imagine the following conversation around a campfire somewhere in the Fertile Crescent a long time ago: Ali: Omar, I have an idea. Omar: What’s that Ali? Ali: These symbols we’re using on the clay. They’re basically pictures of what we see. 2 Carolina López-Ruiz, “Phoenician Literature,” in The Oxford Handbook of the Phoenician and Punic Mediterranean, eds. Brian Doak and Carolina López-Ruiz (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2019), 257. Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West 289 Omar: Yes, that’s true. Ali: Well, I’ve been thinking of another way to do it. Omar: Oh boy. Here we go. What’s your idea this time? Ali: Well, we make a series of sounds when we say a word. Why don’t we represent each of these sounds with a symbol? Take for example the word “sun.” It has three basic sounds: an sssss sound, an uuuuu sound, and an nnnnn sound. [Ali emphasizes the sound of each.] We’d need a symbol for each of these sounds. Once we agree on the symbols, we could write the three in the same order as they came out of our mouths to say the word. Omar: Gosh, Ali, that just might be the stupidest idea you’ve ever had! Hell, it’s the stupidest idea anyone has ever had! Do you know how many symbols we’re going to need! Plus, how are we going to remember them all? It’s easy for us to remember our current symbol for sun because it looks like the sun! What’s so wrong with that! Why can’t you just accept the way things are for once! Ali: Well, Omar, I’m not sure we’d need that many symbols. I reckon we could get away with about forty and that’s not many. Plus, some of the symbols could be similar to something that makes the sounds. Take for example the sssss sound. Snakes make this sound so we could represent the sound with the squiggle “s” which has the shape of a snake. Omar: Forty!? Ali! No! Just listen to me speak. There’s a gazillion different sounds! Imagine yourself in Omar’s position. I have. If someone had come to me back then suggesting that we begin to represent sound rather than what we see, I’d have told him or her they were crazy too. With phonetic exographics, a grapheme (a written atomic symbol) is used to represent a phoneme (the atomic part of speech). Take the written word “hat.” It has three graphemes: h, a, and t, and each has an associated sound or phoneme. With very few symbols (in principle one grapheme for each phoneme), we are able to represent an astonishing number of words. For example, English uses a set of 26 graphemes— the letters of the alphabet. We can trace this structure back through the Romans to the Greeks. In fact, the name “alphabet” is derived from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, “alpha” (a) and “beta” (b). What are the advantages of doing it this way? As I have already remarked, the investment in this approach is not trivial. As children, we first had to learn the sound associated with each letter and for some letters, there are two sounds. For example, the sounds of the letter “c” in “cat” and “city” are different. It works the other way too. The same sounds can represent quite different words. The words “their”, “there”, and “they’re” all sound the same but have different meanings. Of course, we know what spelling to use based on the surrounding words. For example, when we’re learning to decode, we make use of the words appearing before a word to form an expectation of the next word. For example, suppose you’re reading these words: “Many years later, as he faced the firing -----.” What do you think the word after “firing” is? Surely it’s “squad” which is what Gabriel García Márquez chose to begin his novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude. 290 Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West Once we learn the sounds for the letters, we then use this letter-to-sound correspondence to decode words. When we first see the word “cat” on paper, keep in mind that we are already well acquainted with the meaning of the word if it is spoken. Assuming you know the sounds of the letters, when you make those sounds quickly in succession, you then guess that it’s the word for the familiar furry pet. As we decode more and more words, we get better at decoding. In English, there are lots of special sounds when letters are paired. For example, take the sound of the two “ch”s in “church.” That sound is not remotely close to the individual sounds for “c” and “h” made quickly in succession. Another example is the pairing of vowels as in feat, bait, lion, soap, and say. Note that to pronounce these words, you use the hard sound of the first vowel in the pair. Children learn this rule with the rhyme “First one does the talkin, second one does the walkin.” However, like all other “rules” in English, there are exceptions. For instance, for “great,” the reverse of the rhyme is true. When we get to be mature readers, we can read so quickly that we don’t even look at all the letters in a word. There is some evidence of this in garbled word paragraphs. Try reading this: It dsone’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae, or its more famous counterpart, Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch [sic] at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. These sentences are easily read even though there are some significant misspellings. But not all sentences constructed according to this rule are easy to read. Try this one: “One ohgut, ervey day at lsaet, to haer a ltlite snog, raed a good peom, see a fnie ptrucie, and, if it wree pblsisoe, to sapek a few rnbealasoe wdros.” The sentence is Goethe’s (1749–1832 CE) famous advice “One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words.” Clearly our minds are doing some pretty significant gymnastics. Contrast this phonetic approach with one of the ancient pictographic approaches. If young English readers are taught phonetically, they can look at a word they’ve never seen before, sound the letters, and have a good chance of recognizing it. Alternatively, a reader of a pictographic writing system does not have that luxury. They either know the symbol or they don’t. Admittedly, context helps. However a pictographic text does not offer the same decoding potential a phonetic one does. Furthermore, pictographic systems tend to get more abstract as they age. The symbol for sun may have originally resembled the sun, but over time, it looks less and less like the sun. Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West 291 Once readers mature, there is no difference in the speed of their reading regardless of the type of writing system they learn. Mature pictographic and phonetic readers parse at the same speed. The advantage of phonetic languages, then, is that they’re learned more quickly. Glottographic exographics have what Charles Hockett terms a dual patterning struc- ture.3 At one level (the combinatorial level), meaningless individual graphemes can form a word with a meaning. At a second level (the compositional level), words can be combined to form concepts. Exographics also have a Verbatim Effect. Just as with speech, we don’t keep track of the exact code we read but rather the gist or meaning of the writing. If you hear a good joke, you can easily pass the joke on to someone else, but probably not with exactly the same words. The Origin of Greek Exographics The ancient Greeks were not the first to think of constructing a writing system by represent- ing sound. The idea dates at least to Egyptian hieroglyphics which used some symbols to represent sounds and to the Phoenicians who were the first to use a pure phonetic writing system, albeit one without vowels. As we’ve seen, it’s possible to understand the meaning of a word if its spelling is garbled. What happens if we leave out vowels as the Phoenicians did? Here are some words with their vowels removed: snd (send), thnk (think), frst (first), smbls (symbols), and hwvr (however). It’s pretty easy to decode them. In fact, when we text on smart-phones, we leave out a lot of vowels. By contrast there are words we use which require vowels. For example, consider these: bat, bit, but, and bite. It would sometimes be difficult to decode what “bt” means even with context. Barry Powell argues that, about 800 BCE, the Greeks took the Phoenician writing sys- tem and added symbols for vowels.4 For this reason, ancient Greek is considered to be the first purely phonetic script. Greek Education and Literacy It’s generally agreed there were three epochs which preceded the Classical Period of ancient Greece: Mycenaean Greece (1600 BCE–1100 BCE). Mycenae, about 90 miles southwest of Athens, was the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece. It was similar in structure to the city- states in Mesopotamia in that it had a redistributive economy, a political structure headed by a king, and an administrative system complete with officials and scribes. The Mycenaean text, Linear B, was similar to cuneiform and literacy was restricted to a small scribal class. The Dark Age (1200 BCE–800 BCE). With the collapse of the Mycenaean economy, there was no longer a need for administration and Linear B disappeared. 3 Charles Hockett, “The Origin of Speech,” Scientific American 203 (1960). 4 Barry Powell, Homer and the Origin of the Greek Alphabet (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991). 292 Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West Archaic Greece (800 BCE–500 BCE). It was over this period that ancient Greece began to take on the structure that marked the Classical Period, largely centered at Athens. There were developments in politics (the democratic city-states including Athens and Sparta would eventu- ally emerge), economics and trade, warfare, and especially culture. The Greek phonetic script was developed about 800 BCE. It was over this period that highly democratized educational systems emerged with a focus on literacy. David Harvey has written a comprehensive assess- ment of the extent of Athenian literacy. He considers a multitude of evidence sources including ostracism votes, Greek literature, the Athenian courts, and inscriptions. He concludes with this: The great majority of Athenian citizens were, I believe, literate; the average Athenian could read and write with greater facility than the average Spartiate. This is clear from all sorts of evidence. Much of this is conjecture and deduction; but all these conjectures and deductions point in the same direction, and thus confirm one another in a convincing manner.5 Harvey concludes that a significant percentage of the Athenian population was literate and an education system was in place to teach young students. Plato, in his Laws, set aside four years (ages 10–13) for children to learn literacy skills. In sum, the ground for A Class ideation was made fertile by an easily learned writing system and a democratic education system. The combination of these two led to a large num- ber of scholars working on A Class ideas. This period laid the foundation for the achieve- ments that would come in the Classical Period. The Classical Period and A Class Expansion The Classical Period (500 BCE–300 BCE) was one of unparalleled A Class advance. What the Greeks did was incredible. It’s not my intention to document in detail what historians of ideas have already laid out. The Greek advances in art (particularly sculpture), architecture, philosophy (especially logic), mathematics (especially geometry), science, literature, poetry, drama, history, and politics (especially the idea of democracy) have compelled some modern commentators to suggest that the Greeks were actually visitors from another planet. Humour aside, I think there are a couple of important general points to make. The civilizations we’ve studied to this point which have contributed to the A Class were driven to do so to solve practical problems. There was abstract problem solving but it was relatively little compared to what the Greeks were able to do. For example, consider the fol- lowing passage taken from Aristotle’s Prior Analytics that we looked at earlier; If it is necessary that no B is A, it is necessary also that no A is B. For if it is possible that some A is B, it would be possible also that some B is A. If all or some B is A of necessity, it is necessary also that some A is B. 5 Harvey, David, “Literacy in the Athenian Democracy,” Revue des Études Grecques 79, no. 376/378 (Juillet-Décembre 1966): 628. Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West 293 This is typical of the arguments Aristotle presents as he develops his theory of categorical logic. In particular, note the abstract nature of the claims. He doesn’t spell out what A and B are. They could be anything. More generally, consider the treatment of geometry by Euclid. He begins with definitions (lines, points, etc.) and then makes assumptions (premises). From these, he derives theorems. For example, he states and proves the Pythagorean Theorem for right-angled triangles. We continue to do mathematics in the same way today. Effectively it’s a formal method for iden- tifying the patterns that logicians and mathematicians find. The fascinating question is what explains the Greek efflorescence in the A Class? Some scholars suggest it’s the peculiar Greek temperament and genius. I find that hard to believe. As we have seen, our cognitive abilities and those of our ancestors have developed over millions of years. To think that the Greek advance was the result of a mutation leading to enhanced cognitive ability is a real stretch since even a favourable mutation would take generations to spread through the population. In my view, there is a more direct explanation. As the Greek Classical Period opens, the Mesopotamian and Egyptian scripts (cune- iform and hieroglyphics respectively) were well established and practiced by relatively small scribal classes. One of the reasons for this was that these scribal classes derived real power from these skills and therefore were not about to share them or modify the tech- nology of the scripts to make it easier to learn. Hence, if a phonetic text was going to be invented, it would have to have been done off the beaten track and Greece was definitely off the beaten track. This status quo effect has a parallel today. Think of some of the crazy spellings we have in English: colonel, thought, bright. Why aren’t these kernl, thot, and brIt (the capital I is the hard i sound)? Then think about how difficult it would be to change these. The leaders of today’s scribal class (editors, teachers, professors, etc.) have a vested interest in maintain- ing the status quo. Even though modern phone texting has some real advantages (e. g., “r u goin?”), it won’t be mainstream usage any time soon. Change—if it happens at all—will take time. Today there’s only one way to spell a word. Strangely enough, we weren’t always so conservative. Shakespeare is known to have spelled his last name three ways. Coming back to literacy in Mesopotamia and Egypt, literacy was restricted to a relatively small number of people. On the other hand, political power in the Greek settlements coming out of the Dark Age was not as centralized. As the Archaic Age progressed, increasingly more of the population were becoming literate. By the beginning of the Classical Period, a significant fraction of the Greek male population was educated and literate. A part of the ascendance of education and literacy is explained by the ease with which a phonetic script is learned relative to a pictographic script. What we have here—a literate, educated population—is fertile ground for A Class expansion. More thinkers should lead to more ideas. To be more explicit, I think the Greek A Class expansion is explained by an exographics system relatively easy to learn, and by a democratized education system. Related to these, we also have a group effect, what Elizabeth 294 Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West Eisenstein calls “combinatorial intellectual activity.”6 That is, a group magnifies individual efforts exponentially. Is the Alphabet Best for All Languages? I’ll make one more point before moving on. As David Share argues, there has been an over- whelming assumption by language researchers that our alphabet and its phonetic structure are superior for creating text in most languages.7 He refers to this attitude as alphabetism, “the belief that alphabetic writing systems are inherently superior to non-alphabetic systems.” Share suggests that, for some languages, a syllabary might be better. A syllabary represents syllables (usually a consonant sound followed by a vowel sound) by a single grapheme. For example, suppose a given syllabary represents our “ma” sound with the symbol “◊” and the single letter “t” with “t.” Then they could write the word “mat” with “◊t”. Share suggests there is some evidence that children learn syllabaric systems more easily than alphabetic text. It might well be true that English would be better as a syllabary, but I don’t see our one-grapheme-one-phoneme system (with a ton of irregularities) changing anytime soon. The status quo effects are too strong and our system is just not that difficult to learn. Summary The ancient Greeks borrowed a phonetic system and improved it by adding vowels. This made the exographics system easy to learn and this, combined with their democratic educa- tion system, resulted in a high literacy rate and enabled their stunning A Class expansion. 15.2 The Romans and Exographics Background and Literacy The age of Rome ran from 753 BCE–476 CE. As I have already mentioned, the cultural path to the West begins in Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, runs through Greece to Rome, and then on to the West through Europe and Britain. All of the civilizations on this path made a substantial contribution, but it’s hard not to be impressed with what the Romans were able to do. The Romans borrowed heavily from the Greeks, they still made substantial contributions to law, engineering and technology, architecture, and literature. A recent genetics study, published in Science, suggests that, over the Neolithic transi- tional period 7000 BCE to 6000 BCE, there was an influx of farmers from the Fertile Cres- cent (largely modern Turkey and Iran) to Rome.8 Over the period of Rome’s influence the city grew to a population estimated to be 450,000 and reflected a diverse “Mediterranean” 6 Elizabeth Eisenstein, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979). 7 David Share, “Alphabetism in Reading Science,” Frontiers in Psychology 5, Article 752 (2014). 8 Margaret Antonio, et al., “Ancient Rome: A Genetic Crossroads of Europe and the Mediterranean,” Science 366, no. 6466 (November 2019). Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West 295 population. Significantly, this influx and population growth had a lot to do with enhance- ments to transportation including wheeled carts and large ships. The authors conclude with this: These high levels of ancestry diversity began prior to the founding of Rome and continued through the rise and fall of the empire, demonstrating Rome’s position as a genetic crossroads of peoples from Europe and the Mediterranean.9 Genetically, Rome was not built in a day. The Romans spoke Latin and their writing system was phonetic and largely derived from those of the Greeks and Etruscans. Our alphabet today is basically the ancient Roman alphabet with a few modifications over time to take into account the new languages it was representing. For example, the letter “w” was added in medieval times to represent certain sounds in the Ger- manic languages. Latin had a very long run. It was the lingua franca of scholarship and learning at European universities well into the 18th century. The Latin Quarter on the Left Bank of Paris is that area where the Sorbonne and most of the University of Paris are now located. The name goes back to Medieval times when students at the University of Paris had to speak Latin at all times, so students dining in the local bars and eateries could be heard speaking Latin. The corpus of what the Romans wrote comes to us via inscriptions (inscribed on all kinds of media including stone and pottery) and papyrus scrolls written with pen and ink, although sometimes parchment was used. Roman students used erasable wax boards at school. They first marked these boards with a stylus and then “erased” by smoothing with the other end. The Roman education system was heavily influenced by the Greek system. The initial part of the curriculum involved learning how to write letters, words, and numbers. Follow- ing that, students studied grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, and then geometry, arithmetic, music, and astronomy. Some students would also study, law, sculpting/painting, and medicine. The first three subjects were the medieval Trivium, (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic) and the second four, the Quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, music, and astonomy). Most estimates have the literate Roman population at somewhere between 10 and 20%. The Romans left a substantial literature including, essays, letters, histories, epic poems, poems, and plays. Notable authors include Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Catullus, Virgil, Lucretius, and Boethius. Despite the existence of a large literate population, the Romans did not extend the A Class significantly in science and mathematics. Notable exceptions include the work of Pliny the Elder on the natural world, Ptolemy on various topics but most especially his geocentric model of the universe as described in his book The Almagest (he was also one of the first to use diagrams and models of the phenomena he studied), Galen in medical science, and Hero in engineering and experimental science. However, they did make substantial A Class contri- butions in engineering, technology, and architecture which I turn to now. 9 Antonio, “Ancient Rome,” 713. 296 Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West Architecture and Engineering That the Romans made significant contributions to engineering is evident in what remains of their roads, aqueducts, monuments, and amphitheaters. In this section, I intend to focus on a representative case: the design and construction of the Colosseum whose remains still stand in Rome. Let’s again get into the Wayback Machine and imagine that you land in a meeting with representatives of the Emperor Vespasian. They’ve told you that the boss wants an amphithe- ater, a big amphitheater. You have the reputation as the finest architect in Rome and it’s your responsibility to design and build it. How would you start? Before answering that question, let’s get into some of the Colosseum’s features. The site selected for it happened to be on the lake where the previous emperor, Nero, had his palace. In addition, the lakebed contained alluvial soils from an ancient dried-up tributary of the Tiber River. The lake had to be drained before beginning construction. To build the foundation to support a stunning superstructure, an enormous elliptical ring was excavated. This ring was 31 meters wide, 6 meters deep (20 feet) and was filled with Roman concrete. This foundation was raised a further 6 meters above ground level by pouring concrete into an area defined by 3-meter wide forms of reinforced brick. In total, this foundation ring had a perimeter of 530 meters and was 40 feet in depth. The Romans believed in a good foundation. The superstructure is 160 feet high or about 15 stories. To build it, the architects made extensive use of the arch as shown in this picture: There were three levels of arches with 80 arch sections on each level for a total of 240 arch sections. An Etruscan invention, arches were perfected by the Romans. The weight of the structure above the arch is distributed by the keystone (middle stone at the top of the arch) to the two side columns holding up the arch. The structural advantage is that the “hole” in the arch reduces the weight that the structure below must support. SCStock/Shutterstock. com Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West 297 The floor of the Colosseum, where events took place, was made of wood. The wild animals used in Colosseum events were kept in the cellar below the floor and, when required, were winched up to the trapdoors at field level. There is no record of how these lifts worked but a team of archeologists and engineers built a lift based on the space available using the materials that would have been available at the time. It was a difficult undertaking and very complex to build.10 The architects would have had access to Vitruvius’s (he died in 15 BCE) manual of archi- tectural practice De Architectura (“On Architecture”). In it, he laid out three architectural principles—utility, strength, and beauty—which architects still use today. Utility refers to the usefulness of the space. In the context of a stadium, this principle would consider the experi- ence of spectators and would include sightlines, ease of access and egress, washrooms, water supply, etc. The Colosseum was supplied by three of the main aqueducts that fed the city. There were washrooms throughout (I won’t go into the details only to say that waste was carried to the city waste system by the running water fed by the aqueducts). The aqueducts provided drink- ing water. For access and egress, there were a total of 80 entrance/exit gates. Concessions were provided by the food and trinket vendors located just outside the Colosseum. One of the events staged were mock sea battles. For these, the floor of the Colosseum could be flooded to 5 feet of water where replica ships 10–15 feet in length re-enacted his- toric naval battles. The details of how the architects and engineers turned the Colosseum floor into a lake remains a mystery. This brings me to the point of this discussion. Consider this cross-sectional view of the amphitheater structure: 10 Matt Biltz, “A New Recreation Shows How Ancient Romans Lifted Wild Animals Into the Colosseum,” Smithsonian Magazine, June 16, 2015.

Russell Forbes. https://www. gutenberg. org/ files/43416/43416-h/43416-h. htm 298 Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West Here is the key question: would it have been possible for architects and engineers to gather on the site of Colosseum on the first day and improvise this complex structure? The answer is clearly no. Unfortunately, we have very little information on the precise exo- graphics used by ancient architects. Vitruvius refers to eight diagrams (presumably floor plans) in this text, but these diagrams have been lost. The Romans borrowed much from the Greeks so it’s likely Greek practise influenced the Romans. Greek architects gave detailed plans in prose (syngraphai) and from these plans, the proposed structures could be built. However for some of the fine details of these plans, the Greeks worked up scale models. For example, the capital plate for the columns of the Erechtheum (the Temple of Athena Polias located on the Acopolis) looked like this: We know that a three-dimensional scale model of this plate was made to guide its builders. My sources are two books by J. J. Coulton and Antonio Corso.11 Based on his analysis, Corso concludes that the Romans used detailed drawings. Regardless, we can conclude that Greek and Roman architects used exographics in order to plan their structures. You might think that the Colosseum is in the C Class. After all, once complete it’s a concrete real-world object. But it’s not. It resides in the A Class. Any idea that requires exo- graphics to discover (in this case, design and build) is in the A Class. What’s more, there was extensive measurement. And anytime there is measurement, exographics is a necessary requirement for that measurement system to exist. 11 J. J. Coulton, Ancient Greek Architects at Work (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977); and Antonio Corso, Drawings in Greek and Roman Architecture (Oxford: Archaeopress, 2016). Birute Vijeikiene/Shutterstock. com Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West 299 Complex Machines I suggested evidence of complex machines in the previous section. An example is a Roman crane, one that can be seen in the detail of the Haterii Relief, a marble carving circa first century CE and shown below: The relief is quite detailed. The crane on the left appears to be about 40 feet tall (judging its height relative to the height of the men). Note that the treadmill at the bottom is powered by five men inside (there are likely more on the part of the wheel not shown). Note as well the very heavy pulley systems attached towards the top of the crane. Although not shown in the relief, the other ends of these pulley systems would have been fixed at ground level and would have been used to elevate the heavy wooden crane arm (and treadwheel) off the ground and into place. You can see the heavy pulley system that runs straight down from the top of the crane arm. At the bottom of this would have been the apparatus connecting the crane to the object being lifted. It was likely that a Lewis Iron (or Lewisson) was used for this purpose. A Lewis Iron is a heavy metal contraption that is inserted into a “seating” (specially prepared hole) carved into the top of the object being lifted. When lift pressure is applied to the Lewis Iron, it becomes firmly set into the seating. An interesting mystery related to these ancient cranes is how the Romans erected Trajan’s Column. The column is 110 feet high and the platform piece at the top is 59 tons. We don’t Heritage Image Partnership Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo 300 Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West know how the Romans erected this column but Lynne Lancaster has a very interesting take on how it might have been done.12 It is one thing to sit and fashion a surfboard from a blank of wood. Exographics wouldn’t have been required for the first surfboard designer. But if you’re designing something like a treadmill crane, papyrus and a pen are required. Furthermore if you’re charged with erecting Trajan’s Column, papyri and pen are definitely required. Again, human imagination is the main driver but exographics are required to take advantage of that imagination. Empire, Army, and Literacy As we have seen, we’ve evolved some special cognitive abilities to live in large ultrasocial groups of genetically unrelated individuals. One of the explanations is that the benefits of the higher-level organization to the individual outweigh the private costs born by that individual. As we have also seen, cultural institutions are put in place to maintain the larger organization. In all of the polities we’ve looked at, there has been a familiar story. As a society gets larger, it becomes hierarchical with a central administration serving as part of the control mechanism. When the society gets large enough, the administrators will need something other than their heads to keep track of things. Typically, they used the technology of exo- graphics to do this tracking. Rome was the same. The city of Rome grew to a population of 450,000 at its peak and the Roman Empire comprised millions of people over an area on both sides of the Mediterranean that stretched from Spain and Britain in the west to the Euphrates in the east. Moreover, the empire was long-lived, surviving for over a millennium. What sort of cultural institutions are required to build and maintain such empires? Rome used a well-organized Army combined with some very effective deal-making with peoples in the territories they conquered. The Roman Army was highly trained, organized, and rigidly disciplined. To complement their technical prowess, they equipped their forces with the finest kit including light, highly protective armour and a well designed, light sword. Above all, Roman doctrine relied on overwhelming force—they had by far the largest standing Army in the ancient world. The real strength of their military was its logistical system which supported their presence in Rome and an archipelago of garrisons and outposts across their empire. Again, with a large complex organization like the Roman Army, hierarchical by nature, we’re not surprised to find that exographics was a significant managerial tool. There is an extensive documentation of the use of exographics by the Roman Army. For example, Sara Phang writes this The army clerks produced documentation concerning recruitment, daily tasks and long-term missions, the giving and confirmation of orders, furlough, and 12 Lynne Lancaster, “Building Trajan’s Column,” American Journal of Archaeology 103, no. 3 (1999). Chapter 15 The Advance of Exographics to the West 301 annual reports on the composition of units. These records show a high degree of uniformity over space and time.13 At its height, the Roman Army had 400,000 personnel so it would have been very difficult to administer such an organization without exographics. Roman Law and Exographics Early in the history of Rome, there were two classes: plebians (the lower class) and patricians. Laws were based on traditional practices and adjudicated by members of the patrician class called pontiffs who sometimes favoured their fellow patricians when disputes involved a patrician and a plebian. This led to a fair amount of acrimony and social unrest. As a result, the patricians undertook to write a document called The Twelve Tables. It was written in 449 BCE and is the basis for Roman law as we know it today. As the Republic grew, so also did the frequency of disputes. These were not only among Roman citizens but also between Romans and citizens of conquered territories. By the 3rd century BCE, the need for additional laws was recognized and the new profession of jurist was instituted. Basically, jurists were the equivalent of a modern-day lawyer. These jurists wrote a lot about law. Their corpus became the Roman Law of the first couple of centuries CE which eventually morphed into the Justinian Code published in the 6th century CE at the direction of the Emperor Justinian (482–565 CE). I have examined trial procedures in the Empire and scribes were used to record what happened. It is clear that all professional parties to a trial wrote. Given the complexity of this system and its size, exographics played a significant role. What is not clear is how partici- pants used exographics to prepare for proceedings. Summary The Romans clearly made singnificant contributions to the A Class. It included a substan- tial literature in all genres, some science and mathematics, and most especially, engineer- ing. Their achievements in constructing roads, aqueducts, bridges, buildings and monuments earned them distinction as the first civil and mechanical engineers. As I have noted, exo- graphics played a key role in this expansion. 13 Sara Elise Phang, “Military Documents, Languages, and Literacy,” Chapter 16 in A Companion to the Roman Army, ed.

Jack Goody and Ian Watt1 In the last chapter, we looked at how the A Class is affected after the invention of exograph- ics by a society. In this chapter, we’ll look at how the exographics technology diffused to the West via Greece and Rome.

They primarily organized into city-states; the major ones were Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. The Phoenicians were extraordinary seafaring traders. They were expert ship-builders and navigators. These skills supported their keen mercantile abilities. They built colonies and trad- ing outposts all along the northern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean right to the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage was one such colony.

With very few symbols (in principle one grapheme for each phoneme), we are able to represent an astonishing number of words.

Another example is the pairing of vowels as in feat, bait, lion, soap, and say. Note that to pronounce these words, you use the hard sound of the first vowel in the pair.

There were developments in politics (the democratic city-states including Athens and Sparta would eventu- ally emerge), economics and trade, warfare, and especially culture.

Much of this is conjecture and deduction; but all these conjectures and deductions point in the same direction, and thus confirm one another in a convincing manner.5 Harvey concludes that a significant percentage of the Athenian population was literate and an education system was in place to teach young students. Plato, in his Laws, set aside four years (ages 10–13) for children to learn literacy skills.

A syllabary represents syllables (usually a consonant sound followed by a vowel sound) by a single grapheme.

Vitruvius refers to eight diagrams (presumably floor plans) in this text, but these diagrams have been lost. The Romans borrowed much from the Greeks so it’s likely Greek practise influenced the Romans.

You can see the heavy pulley system that runs straight down from the top of the crane arm. At the bottom of this would have been the apparatus connecting the crane to the object being lifted. It was likely that a Lewis Iron (or Lewisson) was used for this purpose. A Lewis Iron is a heavy metal contraption that is inserted into a “seating” (specially prepared hole) carved into the top of the object being lifted.

This led to a fair amount of acrimony and social unrest. As a result, the patricians undertook to write a document called The Twelve Tables. It was written in 449 BCE and is the basis for Roman law as we know it today. As the Republic grew, so also did the frequency of disputes. These were not only among Roman citizens but also between Romans and citizens of conquered territories.

Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved, Pray, reader, for my soul. Epitaph over Alcuin’s grave in the medieval Basilica of St Martin’s, Tours, France. After Rome fell to the barbarians in 476 CE, Europe entered the Middle Ages, where the pop- ular assessment of intellectual historians is that A Class ideation slowed down significantly. Europe went from the ongoing cultural advance of Rome to a loose collection of tribes and kingdoms with nowhere near the ideation potential. In fact, some have argued that European civilization had a near-death experience over the two to three centuries after the fall of Rome.1 Now, let’s flash forward about a thousand years. It’s 1453 CE, about a century after Gutenberg innovated his printing press and moveable type, a technology that quickly dif- fused across Europe. The Protestant Reformation, begun in 1517 CE, is starting to catch on. Amid this turmoil, a Catholic cleric working in the obscurity of what is now northern Poland publishes a short monograph entitled De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolu- tions of the Celestial Spheres) wherein he presents the insane idea that the planets, including the Earth, revolve around the Sun. The cleric is Nicolaus Copernicus and his work represents the opening salvo of the Scientific Revolution. The Renaissance, a period of sustained artistic advance largely in painting and sculpture, had already begun. After the Scientific Revolu- tion, there was the Enlightenment and then the Industrial Revolution. Humanity has not looked back. There has been a sustained exponential growth in A Class ideas over the last five centuries. What happened? How did we manage to go from the darkness of the early Middle Ages to the intense light of the last five hundred years? I am going to argue that religion played a significant role, and the supporting characters will be education, changes in exographic technologies, and a fundamental shift in mentalité. 1 One strong proponent of this view is Kenneth Clark who wrote a book and narrated a television documentary, both entitled Civilisation. The book is Civilisation: A Personal View (London: BBC and John Murray, 1969). 303 304 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 16.1 A General Model of a Society’s Road to A Class Ideation In this book, we’ve studied a number of societies that seem to have followed a remarkably similar pattern of development. There is a productive economy based on agriculture and, as it grows, a strong central government develops. To support the societal role of the government, administrators soon develop a prototypical exographic script. Over time this develops into a fully functioning exographics system to record the society’s language. At the same time, scribal schools develop to educate future administrators in the use of the exographics for government purposes. It is largely this scribal class who produce A Class ideas. The key is that eventually the society gets large enough that memory is not enough to manage. Then administrators need an exographic system to help manage various aspects of the society including taxation to fund the government, a system of justice, and funding a mili- tary force for protection and, in some cases, imperial advance. You can’t manage something like the Roman Empire without a literate class using exographics. There have been some remarkable books on medieval literacy. I’ll mention three here. One is Michael Clanchy’s From Memory to Written Record: England 1066–1307. He makes a strong case that, in England, the grounds for a literate society were formed over the period beginning with William the Conqueror’s arrival in 1066. He explains his thesis in his first paragraph: . . . This formative stage in the history of literacy has received less attention from scholars than the invention of printing in the later Middle Ages, although it is no less important. Printing succeeded because a literate society already existed; that public originated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Writing was not new in 1066, of course, either in England or elsewhere. In the royal monasteries of Anglo-Saxon England, as in other parts of Europe, an original literate culture had been created which was distinguished especially by its illuminated manuscripts of parchment. From these royal and monastic roots, new uses and forms of writing proliferated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and took shapes that would last for generations.2 With the phrase “invention of printing in the later Middle Ages,” he is referring to Guten- berg’s printing press and moveable type.3 What he is arguing is that writing finally reached the lay population and was used in new ways in England in the 12th and 13th centuries. Brian Stock argues essentially the same thing in his The Implications of Literacy. Only he takes it a little further. His first sentence is: “This book is a study of the rebirth of literacy 2 Michael Clanchy, From Memory to Written Record: England 1066–1307, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979), 1. 3 Clanchy’s use of the word “invention” is puzzling because it’s well known that the printing press was invented in China. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 305 and of its effects upon the cultural life of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.”4 Rebirth of literacy? Rosamond McKitterick takes exception to this assessment in the first paragraph of her book, The Carolingians and the Written Word: Literacy and the use of the written word in the early middle ages have hitherto been thought to have been confined to a clerical elite, while society at large conducted its affairs orally. Many, indeed, have seen that beginning of ‘good things’ at the millennium, with a ‘rebirth’ of literacy in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, as if brand new awakenings and skills appeared in the wake of Halley’s Comet to an awed Europe. But if such great changes were taking place in the eleventh century, from what were they a change?5 She then goes on to describe the uses of literacy over the Carolingian Renaissance of the late 8th and 9th centuries under Charlemagne which included much more than the writing of a clerical elite. In fact, McKitterick documents that the Carolingians were doing the same remarkable things with writing as were done in Clanchy’s Norman England. What both identify is the writing done in support of commercial transactions. Private property had been in existence stretching back to antiquity. As we will see, Europe was characterized by increasing com- mercialization. It is quite clear that, from 800 CE, an urban mercantile class arose apart from the agrarian class. What were once settlements soon turned to burgeoning, bustling towns. With this increasing commercialization, the frequency of exchange accelerated. In early medieval times, commercial transactions were largely oral. In addition to the two individuals affecting the exchange, there were witnesses and various forms of ritual- istic behaviour. For instance, in feudal times there was a ceremony of homage and fealty when a vassal was recognized by his lord and awarded a fief. One of the rituals in such ceremonies was the lord kissing the vassal on the lips and then saying that the vassal was his man.6 Another ritualistic behaviour was witness identification by pulling the witness’s ear. The rationale for this is that a slap in the ear would jog the witness’s ear which, at that time, was thought to be where memory resided. Nella Lonza has done an interest- ing history of this practice.7 She suggests that it has its origin in the Twelve Tables of the ancient Roman legal system (5th century BCE). While it is not mentioned explicitly in the Twelve Tables, there are mentions of it in Roman literature including Horace’s Satires and Virgil’s Eclogues.8 4 Brian Stock, The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), 3 5 Rosamond McKitterick, The Carolingians and the Written Word (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 1. 6 Russell Major, “‘Bastard Feudalism’ and the Kiss: Changing Social Mores in Late Medieval and Early Modern France,” The Journal of Interdisciplinary History 17, no. 3 (Winter, 1987): 510. 7 Nella Lonza, “Pulling the Witness by the Ear: A Riddle from Medieval Ragusan Sources,” Dubrovnik Annals 13 (2009). 8 Lonzo, “Pulling the Witness by the Ear,” 31. 306 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe Here is an example of Freising no. 61, a charter executed in what is now Munich in 773 CE: In the name of God, I have been contemplating and considering my soul and the future life, so that I might deserve to receive great favour before the pious Lord. I, Raholf, had been able to gain my very own property as a gift from the divine giver, which my father left to me as an inheritance. It is pleasing to profit for eternity from the transitory life and to give to Him in this life, He who is able to give back in perpetuity and from whom patrimonies are granted and all the changeable things are distributed. Therefore, as we already expressed in writing above, I was able to bring together whatever I acquired in and whatever I shall add to the place called Jesenwang. I hand over and transfer the buildings, enclosures, unfree persons, livestock, territory, meadows, pastures, and whatever I seem to possess there, to the church of the blessed and always pure Virgin Mary, founded at the episcopal house of Freising, and to Christ’s confessor Corbinian. And not only do I give these resources, but I also subject my own body to the service of the church. If anyone tries to go against this charter of donation or wishes to break it, let there be no doubt that he will receive the anger of the divine judge, and when he incurs the wrath of Mary, the mother of God, let him remain condemned under the bonds of excommunication in the displeasure of those saints whose relics are praised there. Let this donation nevertheless remain firm and secure with the subjoined stipulation. Enacted in the episcopal city of Freising in the 26th year of the reign of the lord and most illustrious duke Tassilo on the 18th of the Kalends of September in the presence of Bishop Arbeo and all his clerics. These are the names of the witnesses who were pulled by their ears, as the custom of the Bavarians requires: in the first place, Bishop Arbeo, into whose hands this thing was given. Wulfbert, Magolf, Horskeo priests. Arn, Leudfrid deacons. Chuno. Sullo. Petto. Hitto. Radwald. Arbeo. Wulfleoz. Wicrat and many others. I, Sundarhar, wrote this from the mouth of Bishop Arbeo, subscribed it, and confirmed the witnesses.9 Effectively a charter is an agreement or declaration around an exchange of property, goods, or rights. Here, an individual Raholf, is giving all of his property to the church. There were many of these kinds of “receipts” that predate Charlemagne suggesting that written receipts associated with exchange pre-date the Carolingian Renaissance. The point is that commer- cial writing was going on in Europe long before the supposed post-millennium “rediscovery of writing.” 9 This charter is actually the one taken from a cartulary of the charters issued by the first five bishops of Freising written sometime between 824 and 835 CE.

Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 307 16.2 The Role of Christianity in the Safe-Keeping of Writing The origins of the Christian religion are well known. As it turns out, it was an attractive religion based on some important features including a forgiving, loving God, and eternal salvation. After some very difficult times at the hands of the Romans, things turned around. In 313 CE, with the Edict of Milan, the emperor Constantine made Christianity one of the Empire’s offi- cial religions and in 380 CE, the emperor Theodosius made it the Empire’s official religion. Here is an early map of the Christian population at two points in time: The dark blue shows the areas of Christendom in 325 CE, and the dark and light blue colours show its population in 600 CE. So, at the fall of Rome in 476 CE, the Christian population was spreading quickly throughout Europe. In this advance, another force was at work: monasticism. Christian men and women inter- ested in a more spiritual life settled in monasteries, abbeys, and convents to lead a disciplined life of work and prayer. One of the first guides for monastic life, The Rule of Augustine, was written by St. Augustine in about 400 CE. Other famous guides include the anonymously written Rule of the Master and Benedict’s variant of it, The Rule of Benedict. These manuals describe hierarchies where the abbot has strict authority. As Peter Levi suggests, this author- ity could be specific: It contains the pleasing provision that the abbot has a right to make a monk blow his nose in a manner likely to give least offence to the attendant angels.10 10 Peter Levi, The Frontiers of Paradise: A Study of Monks and Monasteries (New York: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1987), 51. © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company 308 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe One of the more important monastic communities was Cassiodorus’s (487–580 CE). He was a Roman nobleman who built a monastery on his estate at Vivarium around 540 CE. His focus was on education and book production primarily because he saw the need to pre- serve the Roman and Greek culture, and particularly the literate aspect of those cultures. His manuscript, Institutiones, set out an educational curriculum centered on scripture. In addi- tion, the Benedictines moved to Rome where they were directed by Pope Gregory the Great to focus on book reproduction and preservation. I have not been able to establish a connection between these early Benedictines in Rome and the Scrinium, an early repository for church documents, but I have little doubt the Benedictines had a hand in running it. One of the important concepts that Brian Stock presents in The Implications of Literacy is the notion of a textual community. Roughly, a textual community is one where the think- ing, values, self-image, and relations with others outside the community, are guided by an authoritative, fundamental text. It is a literate way of life where those in authority teach and interpret the text. The rest undergo a literate education and socialization process with their peers. A good example of a textual community is a monastery where the literate senior monks teach novices. The authoritative text is the Bible and other texts seek to interpret and educate. Gregory the Great (540–604 CE) played an integral role in requiring the monasteries to take on the role of book preservation and production. Almost all medieval monaster- ies had a scriptorium where monks would work on copying manuscripts. As monasteries spread through Europe so did literacy and the supply of books. The following table shows the growth in the number of monasteries over time in various regions of Europe:11 Century 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Britain 236 460 463 437 437 526 1325 1530 1447 1333 France 586 988 1240 1636 2091 5051 8104 8564 8189 7554 Germany 0 138 622 824 1129 1652 2873 3110 2967 2752 Italy 291 306 495 704 995 2072 2990 3405 3416 3333 AllOthers 80 202 348 784 1691 3184 4833 5339 5251 5397 Total 1193 2094 3168 4385 6343 12485 20125 21948 21270 20369 Note the tremendous growth particularly in France. 11 This table is adapted from Table 5 in: Eltjo Buringh and Jan Luiten Van Zanden, “Charting the ‘Rise of the West’: Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries,” The Journal of Economic History 69, no. 2 ( June 2009). Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 309 Europe underwent significant political, social, and economic change over the period 500–1700 CE. The following sketch is at best an overview but a necessary one in order to show how the role of Christianity and its governance changed. More importantly, it’s a story of the unintended consequences of Christianity’s dependence on exographics and literacy that eventually lead to Modernity’s explosion of human imagination and ideas. It’s a fascinat- ing story. The Church dominated early European medieval politics. Christianity was attractive because it offered the reward of heaven for the faithful who led a virtuous life. The other side of this was the Church’s ability to excommunicate. Any soul excommunicated could not get to heaven. This included Kings and those in secular authority. Effectively there was a partnership between the Church and the secular authority albeit one where the Church was the senior partner. It was important for the Church to protect its orthodoxy. Hence, it had procedures to deal with heretics, those who were accused of taking positions contrary to Church belief. An indi- vidual accused of heresy had a grace period where he or she could repent and withdraw their positions. If the individual refused to renounce, he or she could be stripped of their property, excommunicated, and in egregious cases, be put to death usually by burning at the stake. What’s more, the secular authority was put in charge of meting out any penalty the Church imposed. Any wavering on the part of a King could result in his excommunication. If noth- ing more, this account demonstrates the power in an idea: the existence of heaven and the Church’s ability to take it away with a stroke of the pen. It gave the Church enormous power. Over this same period, there was substantial economic change. Western Europe went from a primarily agrarian, rural society to the initial stages of a commercial, urban one. There was a significant expansion of mercantilism post-millennium and this fueled social change. Education was becoming increasingly important. Yes, there were the guilds where craftsmen learned by doing. But it was also the case that the monasterial and chancery school systems were expanding. The Role of the Reformation There is a massive literature on the causes and consequences of the Reformation beginning with Max Weber’s The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism published in 1905 CE. It’s not my intention to offer any sort of comprehensive summary of this literature. There are many already published. One that I have relied on is the synthesis of Sascha Becker, Steven Pfaff, and Jared Rubin.12 In this section, I intend to focus on that part of the Reformation story that is relevant to literacy and the A Class. 12 Sascha Becker, Steven Pfaff, and Jared Rubin, “Causes and Consequences of the Protestant Reformation,” Explorations in Economic History 62 (October 2016). 310 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe In 1500 CE, the Catholic Church, headed by the Pope in Rome, absolutely dominated western European politics. Every prince and king was beholden to the Church. Its influ- ence was enormous. This changed on October 31, 1517 CE, when the Augustinian monk and professor, Martin Luther, is purported to have pinned his 95 Theses to the front door of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg, thus beginning the Protestant Reformation.13 At that time, Luther was professor of the Bible at the University of Wittenberg. In medi- eval times, a primary vehicle for the evaluation of university students was the disputation where a student, under strict process rules, was charged with defending an assigned question. Effectively, they were debates where participants, including the student, were trying to get at the truth. It was not uncommon for a professor to post theses announcing that he would defend them in a public disputation. Hence, there was nothing untoward about Luther posting his theses. What really got things rolling was Luther’s appending the theses in a letter to the archbishop. Luther’s main complaint was the Church’s selling of indulgences. An indulgence was a benefit that was supposed to reduce the time a sinner would spend in purgatory after death. They were sold for substantial amounts of money. The sellers of indulgences often sold forg- eries and kept the payments for themselves. Sometimes they went as far as promising that souls already in hell could get to heaven.14 Often, the proceeds of indulgences were used to finance church construction. Pope Julius II (1501–1513) issued one to pay for the reconstruc- tion of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Luther questioned the theology justifying indulgences by suggesting that salvation could not be purchased. Another of Luther’s difficulties was the Church’s position that it, and it alone, had the authority to rule on matters of faith and morals. On the contrary, Luther felt that each of the faithful had a right to interpret the Bible as they saw fit. One of his principles was sola scriptura (“by scripture alone”), the idea that the Bible is the sole infallible authority for Christian faith and practice, and not the ecclesiastical leaders of the Church. This was a strong statement which demanded a response from the Church. Luther’s positions made a lot of sense to the people of Saxony and his support grew steadily to the point where Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony (basically the ruler of Saxony) decided to protect Luther largely because, at that time, Saxony was off the beaten track and Frederick liked the notoriety that Luther was drawing. Eventually Luther was called to a special diet (the name given to a deliberative body of the Holy Roman Empire) at Worms in 1521 CE and was challenged to defend his teaching. He responded: Since your most serene majesty and your high mightinesses require of me a simple, clear and direct answer, I will give one, and it is this: I can not submit 13 There is some doubt as to whether Luther actually pinned his theses to the door. However they were eventually presented to the Archbishop of Mainz. See: Volker Leppin and Timothy Wengert “Sources For and Against the Posting of the Ninety-Five Theses, ” Luthern Quarterly 29 (2015). 14 Alberto Cassone and Carla Marchese, “The Economics of Religious Indulgences,” Journal of Institutional and Theoreti- cal Economics 155, no. 3 (Sept 1999). Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 311 my faith either to the pope or to the council, because it is as clear as noonday that they have fallen into error and even into glaring inconsistency with themselves. If, then, I am not convinced by proof from Holy Scripture, or by cogent reasons, if I am not satisfied by the very text I have cited, and if my judgment is not in this way brought into subjection to God’s word, I neither can nor will retract anything; for it cannot be right for a Christian to speak against his country. I stand here and can say no more. God help me. Amen.15 It is really quite startling to read the strength of conviction in this passage. Luther gave it in front of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire who chaired the diet. Luther was asked twice more whether he wished to change his statement and each time he told the diet that what he had said originally was his position and he wasn’t changing it. Bear in mind that this was a heretical position and the Church was not averse to burning heretics at the stake. The trial ended with the Edict of Worms which branded Luther a heretic. He was not arrested however because Frederick the Wise had negotiated his safe passage to and from the diet. Protestantism continued to grow in popularity. Given that the authority for interpreting the Bible on the Protestant side now rested with individuals, it was no surprise to see a vari- ety of Protestant sects come into existence, including Lutherans, Calvinists, Hutterites, and many others. Even less surprising was the fact that all these denominations would have seri- ous disagreements about authority. Over the next 130 years, a number of religious wars broke out ending with the Thirty Years War (1618–1648 CE). Exhausted from conflict, a group of kingdoms, including representatives of the Church, sat down to discuss a new way to work out disagreements. These talks resulted in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. This agreement made religious authority an individual responsibility. It would no longer be determined or enforced by the state. Citizens were free to choose their beliefs without interference from the state. Thus, we have the beginnings of the idea of separation of church and state. The important implication for my argument is that the Church could no longer constrain what a person thought. Now let’s go back to the doctrine of sola scriptura. Luther subsequently argued that, if Scripture was to be the sole authority, then the faithful needed to be able to read Scripture. Consequently, Luther was a strong proponent of literacy and education and urged that the princes of Saxony open schools so more children could be taught to read the Bible. To make things easier, he translated the Bible from Latin to German. These vernacular editions were extremely popular. I will return to just how popular when I look at time series data on the production of books. Surprisingly, Luther even insisted that women be educated. As a result, literacy soared across western Europe. The important implication for my argument is that a high literacy rate translates to potential for more A Class ideators and hence more A Class ideation. 15 Taken from: https://www. bartleby. com/268/7/8. html. 312 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 16.3 Exographic Innovation, 476–1450 CE There are a number of ways exographic technologies can differ: The Material of the Medium. The Mesopotamians used wet clay. The Romans used papyrus sheets. Today we use a variety of materials ranging from paper to the materials of a computer screen. The Inscribing Tool. The Mesopotamians used a stylus shaped from reeds. We use pens, pencils, and the tools that allow us to inscribe on a computer screen. The Form of the Exographic. The Mesopotamians used as many clay tablets as required. The Romans used papyrus sheets glued together to form a scroll. More recently we’ve used books, both real and virtual. The Symbol Set. Sequences of elements drawn from symbol sets are inscribed on the medium to form the message. These sets have changed significantly over time. Let’s now look at how the exographic technology changed over the period 476–1450 CE using Roman exographic technology as a reference. The Coming of the Book One of the great works in literature is Virgil’s Aeneid written in Latin between 29 and 19 BCE. It’s an epic poem about the Trojan hero Aeneas who flees Troy and goes to Italy where he becomes an ancestor of the Romans. The poem begins with perhaps the most famous words in all of literature: “Arms, and the man I sing. . .” I examined the Vergilius Vaticanus, a manuscript held in the Vatican Library.16 It con- tains a 50-page fragment of the Aeneid and was written about 400 CE long after Virgil wrote the original. Virgil’s original was no doubt a scroll. Scrolls were made by joining individual sheets of papyrus and then rolling them up. Going back to the manuscript Vergilius Vaticanus, what jumps out at a modern reader is that there are no spaces between the words. This is termed scriptio continua and it was stan- dard practise until Irish monks began to insert spaces between words in the 7th century CE.17 In addition, there are no small letters, just capital letters. There is no punctuation. There are no paragraph indents and, if you look at the whole manuscript, there are no page numbers. Even if we knew Latin, this would be difficult to read. It would be like trying to read this in English: THEPENISMIGHTIERTHANTHESWORD Certainly, it’s much easier to read if spaces are inserted between the words: THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD 16 http://digi. vatlib. it/view/MSS_Vat. lat.3225. 17 Paul Saenger, Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading (Redwood City: Stanford University Press, 1997), 16 –17. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 313 Did you get the first two words right? It’s amazing how a small change like putting a space between words can make reading so much easier. The Vergilius Vaticanus is a codex, not a scroll. A codex is another name for what we recognize as a book. Its pages are piled on top of one another and then bound on the left. We know that the Roman standard for a manuscript was the scroll. Yet in 400 CE, well before the collapse of the Empire, the codex was the dominant vehicle for manuscripts. Normally, if a technology like the codex is going to disrupt a well-established technology like the scroll, it has to have some significant advantages in order to get manuscript producers to change. In the case of the codex, what were these advantages? A codex would be cheaper to produce because not as much material was required since you can write on both sides of the page. Because a codex requires less page material, it would store more compactly. It would be easier to locate and get to specific points in a codex because you can flip a large number pages easily, whereas, with a scroll, you have to roll your way through all of the intervening pages. It’s akin to the difference between random access and serial access on a computer. There is substantial debate about whether these advantages would have been sufficient to cause manuscript producers to switch to the codex technology. Most scholars feel they wouldn’t have been. So what caused the switch? As it turns out, the early Christians were among the first to use the codex. Keith Elliott suggests there are 42 known gospel fragments dating from the 2nd to the 6th century CE and every one is from a codex.18 This is certainly surprising because the first couple of centuries of that period would have been dominated by scrolls. He goes on to argue that given the volume of words on a papyrus page in a scroll, it would take a 30-meter long scroll to include all four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). Such a scroll would be completely unmanageable. A codex could easily house all four gospels.19 Certainly the early Christian writers would have focussed on the gospels and related writing. Over time, the expansion of Christianity and Constantine’s declaration of it as the official religion of the Empire, would have given considerable impetus to the codex. The Carolingian Improvements to Latin Charlemagne invited the great medieval scholar, Alcuin, to teach in his palace school in 782 CE. Over time Alcuin engineered improvements in Latin writing. He required that every written letter be pronounced, a change that made Latin much easier to learn. The Caro- lingians were the first on the continent to put spaces between words, and, no doubt, were influenced by the scripts of Irish texts. They used small and capital letters; capital letters were used to begin sentences and periods were used to end them. Large capital letters were 18 Keith Elliott, “The Origin of the Christian Codex,” in: The Collected Biblical Writings of T. C. Skeat, Series: Novum Testamentum, Supplements, Volume 113, 2004. 19 We’re not certain whether these early codeces contained all four gospels. But we know the Codex Sinaiticus, housed at the British Library, was written in the 4th century CE and contains all four gospels. 314 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe used to start a new paragraph and question marks were used at the end of sentences where they were required. Finally, they developed a script, Carolingian minuscule, which made text much easier to copy. Over the 8th and 9th centuries, scholars copied out a large number of classical Roman texts that had been largely forgotten. They did so in Carolingian minuscule. Today, over 7,000 manuscripts have survived from this period. Ulrich Blum and Leonard Dudley document that the Carolingians defined a form of Latin writing that became the standard across western Europe. They go on to argue that it was part of the reason for the increase in population and wealth over the period 1000 CE–1300 CE.20 Their test of this proposition with time series regressions using population and economic data gives substantial support for their hypothesis. Changes in Media Over the millennia, we’ve inscribed a variety of media. Papyrus was the medium of choice for thousands of years. Over time, as the papyrus plant became scarcer, we went to parch- ment, a material made from sheep and calfskin.21 To make a sheet of parchment, the skin (with the hair attached) was soaked in a lime solution for a period of three to ten days depend- ing on temperature. They were then washed with water. At this point, it was easy to remove the hair but both surfaces would still have been too rough for inscribing once dry. So the skin was stretched on a frame and, while still wet, both sides were scraped with a crescent-shaped knife called a lunellarium. Then the skin was dried. Once dry, both sides were slightly wet- ted again then sanded or “pounced” with a pumice stone. This was sometimes done twice. Finally, both surfaces were rubbed with chalk to whiten and smooth the surface. This is pure C Class ideation that took took centuries to perfect. The Chinese were the first to make paper out of rags in antiquity. The technique diffused through trade to the Middle East about the 8th century CE and then made its way to western Europe about 12th century CE. The paper we write on today is made in a highly mechanized, complex two-stage process where pulp is manufactured from wood chips and then this pulp goes through a long proce- dure to produce paper. Inscribing Technologies Quill pens were normally made from goose, swan, or turkey feathers. The feathers were stripped away and the quill was left to dry for a few months. Once dry, the greasy outer skin could be scraped off and the pith inside the quill removed. The tool to shape the nib of the quill was a short sharp knife not surprisingly called a penknife. Two angled cuts were made 20 Ulrich Blum and Leonard Dudley, “Standardized Latin and Medieval Economic Growth,” European Review of Economic History 7, no. 2 (2003). 21 Sometimes the paper made with calfskin is called vellum. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 315 at the end of the quill, the second at a sharper angle. Next, the end of the quill was snipped to make a sharp edge at the desired thickness. Finally, the end of the nib was split. This split enabled the smooth flow of ink from the pen to the parchment. Over a day, a scribe might use up to 60 quills and these needed to be maintained. As writing progressed with the same quill, the end of the nib would wear and ultimately it would have to be cut to restore a working business end. As the 19th century opened, there were 27 firms selling quill pens in London. Annual sales in England were in the hundreds of thousands. It wasn’t until quills were replaced by pens with steel nibs that this maintenance require- ment was relaxed. But it was a long time, towards the end of the 19th century, before these steel nibbed pens were accepted as better. Maygene Daniels documents the history of steel- nibbed pens and other writing instruments (including fountain pens, the pencil, ball point pens, and typewriter) in a very interesting paper.22 What is fascinating is the nature of the development. It’s a long story of many incremental improvements interspersed with a number of technological breakthroughs. It’s hard-core C Class innovation over a period of a mil- lennium. Of course, the breakthroughs continue. Today, the electronic word processor on a computer has replaced the typewriter. A New Inscribing Technology: The Printing Press The Chinese were the first to invent the printing press in about 250 BCE. Basically, they used inscribed wooden blocks. They were also the first to invent moveable type in about 1045 CE. In northern Europe, over the period 1440–1450 CE, Johannes Gutenberg innovated (indepen- dently we think) a printing press and moveable type. Gutenberg’s contribution was to produce a small rectangular piece of metal with a par- ticular letter raised on the surface of one end. He did this by pouring a molten alloy of lead, tin, and antimony into a specialized mold. When the alloy had cooled enough, he snapped out the piece of type. He was a goldsmith by training so had the expertise to come up with such a process. His method yielded a large number of identical pieces of type for each letter. Once these pieces were made, they could be moved around very quickly in a form depending on what was being printed. The form was inked and, with the press, a blank page and the form were brought together to produce a page of text. Before this, presses had a woodblock form: basically, the block was inked and then paper was pressed against it to obtain a printed page. The problem was that the blocks were dif- ficult to make and not easy to change. Gutenberg’s great contribution was the development of a process to produce type that was easily assembled into forms. Once work was finished with the form for a particular page, the same pieces could be used to assemble another form for the next page. With Gutenberg’s system, mistakes could be fixed easily. If a word was 22 Maygene Daniels, “The Ingenious Pen: American Writing Implements from the Eighteenth Century to the Twentieth,” The American Archivist 43, no. 3 (Summer, 1980). 316 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe misspelled, a printer would easily remove or add the correct letters. But with blocks, a mis- spelled word required a whole new block. Gutenberg’s first printing was the Bible, sometimes called the Gutenberg Bible. A picture of a page from that Bible is shown below: Each letter on this page corresponds to one piece of type. Note the artwork at the top of the second column. This work was done by hand by artists called rubricators. At that time, most inks were water-based. These didn’t work well with Gutenberg’s press so he developed a special ink with high metallic content and better adherence. Now to the larger societal effects of Gutenberg’s innovation. Before Gutenberg, manu- scripts were hand written in scriptoria, usually in monasteries. The scriptorium was a large room where monks sat at elevated desks with quills in hand. Relative to the printing press, there were two problems. First, there were transcription errors and these would compound as succeeding generations of the manuscript were produced. Second, producing copies is expensive relative to the costs of production with a printing press. Jeremiah Dittmar sug- gests that the price of printed books fell by two-thirds shortly after the printing press was invented.23 23 Jeremiah Dittmar, “Information, Technology, and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 126, no. 3 (2011). Osugi Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 317 Let’s first look at the production of manuscripts in western Europe prior to the arrival of the printing press. The following table gives the number of manuscripts produced each century over the 10th to 15th centuries:24 Century 10 11 12 13 14 15 #Manuscripts 135,637 212,030 768,721 1,761,951 2,746,951 4,999,161 Note that the number of manuscripts grows steadily but jumps to about 5 million produced in the 15th century, the century the printing press arrived. Now let’s look at the estimates of printed books subsequent to the introduction of the printing press. The following table presents estimates of the number of books printed in each half century beginning in 1454 and running to 1800: Half Century 1454 to 1500 1501 to 1550 1551 to 1600 1601 to 1650 1651 to 1700 1701 to 1750 1751 to 1800 #Printed Books (1,000s) 12589 79017 138427 200906 331035 355073 628801 Note that just in the last half of the 15th century, 12.6 million printed books were produced which is double the number of manuscripts scribed in the previous five centuries. In the first half of the 16th century, the period where the Reformation occurred, 79 million printed books are produced. That is an astonishingly high increase in the number of books. Thereafter, the growth is not as rapid but it’s a steady exponential growth. 24 This table is adapted from Table 1 in: Eltjo Buringh and Jan Luiten Van Zanden, “Charting the ‘Rise of the West’: Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries,” The Journal of Economic History 69, no. 2 ( June 2009). 318 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe This data strongly suggests that Gutenberg’s printing technology diffused quickly and that there was a strong demand for books, a demand strongly influenced by the Reformation. Elizabeth Eisenstein is an authority on the effects of the printing press and has summa- rized her findings in two major works.25 Her position is this: The impact of printing, experienced first by literate groups in early modern Europe, changed the character of the Italian Renaissance and ought to be considered among the causes of both the Protestant Reformation and the rise of modern science.26 I think it is safe to say that the printing press was not the sole cause of the Reforma- tion. Luther’s commitment to his positions was not influenced by the existence of the printing press. However, it was fortunate that the printing press had come along just before Luther’s mission to enhance literacy among his followers. Bibles and other related printed materials were cheaper, in good supply, and this gave Luther’s Reformation sig- nificant momentum. Gutenberg’s innovation of the printing press and the Reformation increased the literate population and this ought to have given A Class ideation a significant boost. It’s not surpris- ing that we soon observe that the Renaissance (about 1400–1600 CE) continues, the Scien- tific Revolution begins with Copernicus in 1643, and about the same time, the Enlightenment (about 1600–1800 CE) begins. Not long after the Industrial Revolution begins. 16.4 The Progress of Education As I have argued, a scholar contributing to the A Class requires an imagination and an exo- graphics technology. One of the key inputs to imagination is education. Clearly an educa- tion provides literacy, but it also gives a scholar a knowledge base from which to work. If a scholar is going to argue a new idea about, say, the Trinity, then that person needs a working knowledge of the Trinity and, in medieval times, this was acquired through the education system and reading. After the fall of the Roman Empire, there was still a need to manage bureaucracies and economic exchange, although on a much smaller scale and certainly there was a more local element to this work. If bureaucracies needed to be managed, then there was a concomitant requirement for literacy. So, by necessity, even the “barbarian” peoples overrunning Rome needed a literate class to manage the affairs of trade and governance. 25 These are: Divine Art, Infernal Machine: The Reception of Printing in the West from First Impressions to the Sense of an Ending (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011), and The Printing Press as an Agent of Change: Com- munications and Cultural Transformations in Early Modern Europe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979). 26 Eisenstein, Elizabeth, “The Emergence of Print Culture in the West,” Journal of Communication 30, no. 1, (1980): 99. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 319 As I have already indicated, what made the difference in Europe was Christianity’s deep reach into society. The Church was by far the biggest political entity in Europe. It had a large bureaucracy and, whenever you have bureaucracy, you have a requirement for literacy. In addition, the Church was the quintessential textual community based on the Bible. Conse- quently, there were monastic and chancery schools set up across Europe and these generally taught the Trivium and the Quadrivium. Charlemagne, Alcuin, and the Carolingian Renaissance In the period prior to 1000 CE, the European population was largely rural and uneducated. However, there were pockets of enlightenment and education. One of these was the Carolin- gian Franks who went through their Renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries. Charlemagne (742–814 CE) ruled over much of Western Europe from 768 to 814. He was a wise, skillful leader who placed great value on literacy and education and is largely responsible for initiating the Carolingian Renaissance. Charlemagne’s principal architect of this awakening was the English scholar and cleric Alcuin (735–804 CE). We know a lot about Alcuin because much of his extensive correspondence survives. He was educated at the cathedral school in York where he later became headmaster. In 781 CE, he met Char- lemagne who invited him to his court in Aachen. Charlemagne wanted to bring together the best teachers and scholars that Europe had to offer and Alcuin was one of them. He joined the palace court in 782 CE. Soon after, in 787 CE, Charlemagne issued the Charter of Modern Thought, a declara- tion that his program of reform would include the establishment of a school system to bring literacy to as many as possible. It began in the palace school where the program of instruction moved from one of military arts and court protocols to one of general learning and literacy. Subsequently, he instructed the monastery and cathedral schools across his empire to take in lay students as well as those students who were training for permanent positions within these institutions. Children were offered to monasteries at a very young age and, not surprisingly, young students and their monastic “parents” (teachers) formed a close emotional bond. In this regard, Alcuin wrote to his teachers at York later in his life: You tended the impressionable years of my infancy with motherly affection and upheld me in the wanton period of boyhood with holy patience, teaching me with fatherly correction and fortifying me with a religious education until I became a man.27 27 I’ve taken this quote from this paper: Mayke de Jong, “From Scolastici to Scioli: Alcuin and the Formation of an Intellectual Elite,” in Alcuin of York: Scholar at the Carolingian Court, eds. L. A. J. R. Houwen and A. A. MacDonald (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1998), 45. 320 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe He wrote to this same group about his wish to be buried at York: Dearest fathers and brothers in the world, remember me! I am yours, whether in life or in death. Perhaps God will pity me, so that you may bury the child you taught when he is old. And if another place is assigned to my body, yes I believe my soul will be granted peace with you by God’s grace through your prayers, whatever its place is to be.28 Both these passages are strikingly well written and clearly express Christian sentiments. In particular, note in the second that he believes he has a soul distinct from his body. It’s cer- tainly evident that he had received the standard liberal arts education of that time (grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music). de Jong also writes this about Alcuin’s concern for his students: He was ever anxious about the fate of his pupils, sending them countless letters cajoling and even hectoring them into a more virtuous life—calling them by affectionate nicknames such as ‘Animal’, ‘Cuckoo’, or ‘Calf’.29 Modern professors would do well to take this page out of Alcuin’s playbook. But students could get into trouble. One of Alcuin’s best students was Rabanus Maurus and, in turn, Rabanus’s best student was Gottschalk who, when he matured, took a different view of the doctrine of predestination. Based on his study of Scripture and the writings of St Augustine, Gottschalk argued that the Lord selected some people for heaven and others for eternal damnation. This conflicted with the Church’s view on free will. Gottschalk and Rabanus clashed at the Council of Mainz in 848 CE. The following year he was called to appear before Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims. Hincmar found him guilty of heresy and Gott- schalk spent the rest of his life at the monastery at Hautvillers. Back then, ideas could get you into trouble and if you were going to take views contrary to the doctrine of the Church, you could get into serious trouble. When Alcuin arrived at Charlemagne’s court, Charlemagne, an illiterate, decided to educate himself. He became a pupil of Alcuin’s who Charlemagne’s biographer, Einhard, referred to as “the most learned man in the entire world.” Given his esteem for knowledge and literacy, Charlemagne had a high regard for Alcuin and referred to him as his master. As documented by Tom McLeish and Mary Garrison, Charlemagne and Alcuin had a very interesting exchange of letters in 998 CE on the retrograde movement of Mars in the heavens.30 At the time, Charlemagne was at war with the Saxons. Somehow, he observed the retrograde motion and supposed disappearance of Mars and became worried about it. He was so concerned that he wrote Alcuin to get his advice. 28 de Jong, “From Scolastici to Scioli,” 1998. 29 de Jong, “From Scolastici to Scioli,” 1998. 30 Tom McLeish and Mary Garrison, “Reversals in Wartime: Alcuin and Charlemagne Discuss Retrograde Motion, Inter- faces 8, (2021). Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 321 Let’s put this in perspective. If you observe the outer planets in the heavens, they gener- ally move from west to east. Except that sometimes they stop and then start to head back to the west before eventually stopping again and reversing their direction and heading east. This motion is not peculiar in a heliocentric solar system where the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. Back then, they had no idea of the way the solar system worked. They could only see this odd (but regular) retrograde motion. Charlemagne, based on his astronomy studies with Alcuin, knew about the retrograde motion of certain heavenly bod- ies. What puzzled him was that Mars disappeared from sight for the better part of a year. Charlemagne was worried about what effect this might have on his success in battle. Was God trying to send a signal with this very odd heavenly motion of Mars, the heavenly body named for the Roman god of war? We don’t have either of the letters that Charlemagne wrote. But we have both Alcuin’s replies and these give us a clue as to what Charlemagne was asking. Based on Alcuin’s first response, it appears that Charlemagne asked him about the disappearance of Mars and pos- sibly it’s retrograde motion. Astronomers today can tell us that the motion of Mars in 997 and 998 CE would have been very difficult to observe and hence a neophyte observer may not have been able to see it when it was actually in view. Alcuin responded that Mar’s disap- pearance was natural and also that different observation posts on the Earth could yield dif- ferent results. Alcuin ends the letter by suggesting that, just as Mars will reappear, so too will Charlemagne be returned home safe from battle. For whatever reason, Charlemagne was not satisfied with Alcuin’s response so wrote him another letter. Charlemagne expressed his worry that the long disappearance of Mars was a bad omen for his success against the Saxons. Again, Alcuin appealed to Pliny and other sources from antiquity to reassure Charlemagne that there was nothing untoward about Mars’s movement, that according to the ancients, the vanishing was to be expected. There is no record or reference to further discussion between the two so it was likely that Alcuin’s “technical” explanation based on ancient authorities reassured Charlemagne. The Urban and Mercantile Expansion We know that Europe underwent a considerable economic and social transformation between 800 CE and 1,500 CE. Through the early Middle Ages, Europe was basically an agrarian soci- ety assembled around small villages. Exchange was done largely by barter. After 1,000 CE, agricultural production expanded considerably due to climate change and a number of techno- logical innovations including wind and hydro-power to run grain mills and other processes, the wheeled carruca plough pulled by shoed horses rather than oxen, and a shift from a two-field to three-field rotation of crops. These all served to make agriculture much more productive. It’s worth making a parenthetic note. Much of this book is about A Class ideation. How- ever as I have pointed out, there is also C Class ideation, ideation that does not require exographics. All of the improvements to agriculture in medieval Europe were C Class inno- vations that contributed to a substantial cultural change. 322 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe As this agricultural expansion continued, the towns and cities grew in population and trade among them and the urban centers in the Arab east increased significantly. Some esti- mates have the population of Europe doubling between 1,000 CE and 1,300 CE and Angus Maddison estimates the per capita GDP almost doubled over the period 1,000 CE to 1,500 CE.31 This expansion of trade gave rise to a merchant class, a significant growth in money supply and investment capital, and the movement away from barter to an exchange economy. Post millennium, we start to see some interesting things happening. Charles Homer Haskins was the first to note the renaissance of the 12th century: This century [the 12th century] was in many respects an age of fresh and vigorous life. The epoch of the Crusades, of the rise of towns, and of the earliest bureaucratic states of the West, it saw the culmination of Romanesque art and the beginnings of Gothic; the emergence of the vernacular literatures; the revival of the Latin classics and of Latin poetry and Roman law; the recovery of Greek science, with its Arabic additions, and of much of Greek philosophy; and the origin of the first European universities. The 12th century left its signature on higher education, on the scholastic philosophy, on European systems of law, on architecture and sculpture, on the liturgical drama, on Latin and vernacular poetry.32 The monastic and chancery schools did not have sufficient capacity to educate all who wanted admission so a great many private schools came into existence. Importantly, universities came into existence: Bologna (1088 CE), Salamanca (Spain, 1134 CE), Oxford (1096–1167 CE), Paris (1160–1250 CE), and Cambridge (1209 CE). Over time, many more universities were added. The following table shows the number of universi- ties added each century from the 12th to 17th centuries:33 Century Change in the Number of Universities 12 7 13 20 14 44 15 118 16 150 17 182 31 Angus Maddison, “The West and the Rest in the World Economy: 1000–2030,” World Economics 9, no. 4 (October– December 2008). 32 Charles Homer Haskins, The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1927), vi. 33 This table is adapted from Table 7 in: Eltjo Buringh and Jan Luiten Van Zanden, “Charting the ‘Rise of the West’: Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries,” The Journal of Economic History 69, no. 2 (June 2009). Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 323 Note the high rate of growth over time. Also note the substantial increase in the 15th century, the century Gutenberg innovated his printing press. In the context of A Class ideation and exographics, universities are interesting. They are a microcosm of the difficulties that exographics has had breaking into oral cultures. As I’ve documented, this problem goes right back to Plato’s decidedly negative views on the writing medium. In the chase for truth, Plato saw it as inferior to two minds working dialectically in oral discourse. We now know a lot more about the good things exographics can do for us but in the early days of universities, scholars were influenced by the classical ideas of antiquity. Guided by Plato’s ideas, the early universities had regulations in place which prohibited students from taking notes in class. They also outlawed lecturing where teaching masters spoke slowly enough to enable student note-taking. In 1452, Cardinal Estoutville eliminated the strict rules banning note taking at the University of Paris. He also argued that teaching masters had to lecture in such a fashion as to allow students to take notes, although it appears he left the choice open to the individual lecturers, permitting both types of lecturing.34 This prohibition on note-taking supported the belief that students’ minds were strengthened if they didn’t take notes. Note-taking, as their argument went, would undermine and weaken the strength and quickness of mind that purely oral learning developed. When the first universities came into existence, the main vehicle used to test a stu- dent’s knowledge and ability to reason was an oral dialectical argument termed a disputa- tion. There were usually two student participants even though only one was being tested, and their debate, usually along a strict set of procedural rules, was mediated by the teach- ing master, effectively the advisor of the student being tested. Teaching masters were also expected to take part in their own disputations. These were usually open to the public and held on holidays and feast days. In the case of student disputations, usually the teaching master posed a question, something like “Do animals have a free will?”, the students would take some time to prepare, and then the debate would be convened. The history of how disputations changed over time is quite interesting. The main vehicle of examination for the Ph. D. at modern universities is a written dissertation, a practice that only began in the 18th century. The fact that orality was the primary medium of thesis examination for centu- ries speaks to the difficulty of exographics becoming the medium of choice. Even though the written dissertation is the main vehicle of examination today, we still ask students to defend their ideas orally. So, orality was firmly the medium of choice in early university pedagogy. Over time, the dominate medium became exographics because we discovered it could take us places we couldn’t reach with just orality. 34 Robert S.

Accessed Sept. 28/2014. 324 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 16.5 The Change in Mentalité and the Arrival of Modernity When looking at scholarship over the Middle Ages, you see that much of the focus was on the wisdom of the ancients and, because Christian scholars were doing a lot of writing, the wisdom and interpretation of the Bible. The ancient texts were analyzed with commentary for centuries. The Renaissance takes its name from the rediscovery of classical scholarship and the arts of Rome and Greece. Eventually, the Renaissance gave way to a new way of thinking, a mentalité that focussed on looking forward rather than backward. Some scholars have referred to this change of direc- tion as Modernity, which occurred over an extended period of time. Scholars, artists, and others began to realize that perhaps the ancients weren’t the only source of knowledge. They began to believe that they too could produce important ideas. This is no more evident than in a realiza- tion by the Jesuit Jose de Acosta (1539 CE–1600 CE): I will describe what happened to me when I passed to the Indies. Having read what poets and philosophers write of the Torrid Zone, I persuaded myself that when I came to the Equator, I would not be able to endure the violent heat, but it turned out otherwise. For when I passed [the Equator], which was when the sun was at its zenith there, having entered the zodiacal sign of Aires, in March, I felt so cold that I was forced to go into the sun to warm myself. What could I do then but laugh at Aristotle’s Meteorology and his philosophy? For in that place and that season, where everything, by his rules, should have been scorched by the heat, I and my companions were cold.35 Acosta now had direct evidence that the ancients, in this case Aristotle, didn’t get it all right. Others had the same realization and this is clear in the history of the period. Not long after this, we have the Enlightenment and Kant’s famous pronouncement “Sapere aude” or “Dare to know” and stretching it a bit, “Dare to think for yourself.” There is still respect for and knowledge of the wisdom of the ancients, but the outlook is forward with new ideas. Rightly or wrongly, I’m going to refer to this change of outlook, this new focus on the future as Modernity and it largely begins with the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. In the following four sections, I am going to explore some effects of exographics changes and I want you to keep in mind the two constraints on A Class thinking. The first is the effects of Christian doctrine. For a long period of time over the Middle Ages, any new idea contrary to Church orthodoxy was dealt with harshly. The other constraint on thinking is that, to do A Class ideation, a scholar must look back to determine what the current thinking 35 Taken from: Anthony Grafton, New Worlds, Ancient Texts (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1992). Grafton’s bibliographic entry is: J. de Acosta, The Natural and Moral History of the Indies, 1590, translated by E. Grimston, New York. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 325 is on the issue the scholar is examining. With those constraints in mind, let’s now examine a number of important developments. 16.6 Music, Exographics and the A Class In the 8th century CE, in Europe, composers began to work through their creations on paper. Richard Taruskin writes about the importance of this change: Something over a thousand years ago music in the West stopped being (with negligible exceptions) an exclusively oral tradition and became a partly literate one. This was, from our perspective, an enormously important change. The beginning of music writing gives us access through actual musical documents to the repertories of the past and suddenly raises the curtain, so to speak, on developments that had been going on for centuries. All at once we are witnesses of a sort, able to trace the evolution of music with our own eyes and ears. The development of music literacy also made possible all kinds of new ideas about music. Music became visual as well as aural. It could occupy space as well as time. All of this had a decisive impact on the styles and forms music would later assume. It would be hard for us to imagine a greater watershed in musical development.36 Taruskin is suggesting that using exographics to represent music “made possible all kinds of new ideas.” How so? Certainly written music has gotten more complex since the tenth century CE. Here is a snippet of exographics for an early Gregorian chant: 36 Richard Taruskin, The Oxford History of Western Music. Vol. 1, Music from the Earliest Notations to the Sixteenth Cen- tury, 6 volumes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 1. Source: 9th century Gregorian chant. 326 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe The “stenographic” marks above the words indicate how the words are to be sung. Contrast that with modern music notation: This modern notation allows composers to construct polyphony where players in an orchestra or choir will play different parts. It’s a step up from the monophony of Gregorian chant. To understand polyphony, we first need to understand the general structure of music exographics. Here is a snippet of modern music notation: Note that there are 5 lines and 4 spaces between. This set of lines and spaces are termed the staff or stave. Essentially this notation captures a number of dimensions of the music. There is a vertical dimension: notes placed higher on the staff have higher tones or pitches. The second dimension is the horizontal dimension and it specifies the order the notes are to be played. Another dimension of this notation is the shape of the notes. The shape of a note indicates how long the note should be held. So effectively we have a three-dimensional exographics system on a two-dimensional sur- face. The vertical placement of notes on the staff is the tone, the left to right sequence of notes Arcady Dmitry Rukhlenko Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 327 gives the order they are played, and the shape of the notes is the foundation of the piece’s rhythm. There are many more aspects of musical notation and the history of these are described in detail in a volume by Richard Rastall.37 Certainly, the invention of staff notation was a major step forward in music exo- graphics. It’s attributed to Guido d’Arezzo (990–1050 CE) although some scholars have disputed this.38 Let’s now come back to the idea of polyphony. If you listen to Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons, different instruments play different melodies (3 violin parts, 1 viola part, and 1 cello part). When these melodies are played together, they result in a beautiful piece of music. This mixing of melodies is termed polyphony and our earliest knowledge of it dates to an English chorale arrangement around 900 CE. It is difficult to imagine how something like The Four Seasons could be imagined without exographics support. It would have been impossible for Vivaldi to keep track of all parts of the piece in his mind. Hence, like mathematics, some kinds of music would be impossible to compose without exographics. Pachebel One of my favourite classical pieces is Johann Pachebel’s (1653–1706 CE) Canon in D Major. Here is the first page of the oldest surviving manuscript of it: 37 Richard Rastall, The Notation of Western Music: An Introduction, Second Revised Edition (London: Travis and Emery, 2008). 38 See John Haines, “The Origins of the Musical Staff,” The Musical Quarterly 91, no. 3-4 (2009). Source: Johann Pachelbel’s, “Canon and Gigue in D major,” (1680). 328 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe Note that there are four different violin parts. The coordination of these four parts into a whole is not something that could easily be done without exographics. Bach Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750 CE) is noted for his great polyphony. Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring is an example. It comprises two melodies and each separately is beautiful. When they are played together, it’s sublime. A composer writing polyphony needs to understand how notes fit together and the sound those simultaneously played notes are going to produce. Some musicologists have suggested that Bach understood how to put together polyphony better than any other composer, a knowl- edge that is thought to have come from his transcription of Vivaldi concertos for the organ. This knowledge certainly served him well in his work composing fugues and canons where there is evident pattern and structure. For example, Crab Canon, taken from his Musical Offering (1747), is a single line of music. If it is played forward and backwards simultane- ously, the result is a wonderful piece of music that can be played indefinitely. Composing Modern Music in the Age of Recording Technology Sound is fleeting. Like speech, it vanishes shortly after it’s heard. The composer has to have a way of maintaining a record of a piece as it is put together. Like all other A Class ideas, exographics tends to be the preferred technology for composers to overcome the limitations of their memories. There are other approaches to music composition, ones that rely on sub- stitutes for exographics. Certainly, Keith Richards didn’t need staff notation to come up with his opening riff on Satisfaction. However, as it turns out, technology was involved. It was Richards’s practice after a night of partying to record whatever noodling he did before going to sleep. As he explained in his autobiography Life, he woke up one morning and hit the play button on the recorder and, this produced the three-note up/down riff for Satisfaction. In contrast, Mick Jagger is on record that he uses pen and paper to write lyrics. As the examples above illustrate, rock composers have little need for pen and paper. The same is generally true of jazz musicians who rely on improvisation so there is usually only a partial plan for performance. When Miles Davis (1926–1991 CE) went into the studio to make Kind of Blue, he only had a rough outline of what he wanted to do. This shows up in the live perfor- mances of So What, the signature song from the album. You never hear the same improvised melody twice but the support chording is always the same. Summary The history of composition in music is the story of the synthesis of two kinds of innovation. One is the evolution of music exographics. The other is the composition of the music itself. Our current exographics system, developed over a long period of time and based on different Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 329 note shapes superimposed on staff notation, captures the essential three dimensions of music (the notes, their order, and the rhythm). In turn, this evolving representational system has enabled us to compose polyphony of astonishing complexity and beauty. Setting aside composition for the moment, it’s worth noting that exographics enables the coordination of large ensembles. The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has 128 members. The coordination of these musicians without sheet music would be impossible. Not all music requires exographics. Today modern recording technologies are substitutes for exographics. Modern complex polyphony still requires paper and pen. Recent research seems to confirm this. Catherine Letondal and Wendy Mackay report some interesting research on the use of exographics by 12 modern composers who employ the computer in parts of their compositional process.39 Paper and pen tend to be used at the initial sketching stage because the majority of the composers interviewed had an idiosyncratic system for representing these sketches on paper. 16.7 The European Shift to Hindu-Arabic Numbers Up to about 1,000 CE, the only number system used in Europe was the Roman system. But by the end of the 16th century, Hindu-Arabic numbers had taken over. For centuries, the exo- graphic for twenty-eight was “XXVIII.” Then it switched to “28.” Why? The basic Roman numbers and their Hindu-Arabic equivalents are as follows: I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, and M = 1000. The Roman system is a purely additive one. For example, to determine what number LXVII is, we simply add the values: 50 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 67. To add two Roman numbers, say LXVII + CLXXXVI, we would first concatenate the two strings by symbol-type: LXVII (67) + CLXXXVI (186) = CLLXXXXVVIII (253). Then we would simplify the resulting string by symbol-type going from right to left. In this case, there is nothing to be done with the three I’s on the right. But VV is an X so we could rewrite to CLLXXXXXIII. But the 5 X’s are an L, so we would have CLLLIII. Then two Ls make a C. We end up with CCLIII which is 253. Countless writers have suggested the superiority of Hindu-Arabic numbers by citing the difficulty of multiplying Roman numbers. However the Romans actually struck on a pretty nifty way to do multiplication which, for clarity, I’ll illustrate with a Hindu-Arabic example: 16 × 132 = 8 × 264 = 4 × 528 = 2 × 1056 = 1 × 2112. 39 Catherine Letondal and Wendy Mackay, “The Paperoles Project: An Analysis of Paper Use by Music Composers,” CoPADD, the 2nd International Workshop on Collaborating Over Paper and Digital Documents, Nov 2007, Londres, United Kingdom. 〈hal-01299646〉. 330 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe You can see what’s happening. At each step, the smaller number is halved and the larger is doubled. Eventually this gets you to the final answer, 2,112. Admittedly these numbers are contrived but the same principle can be applied if the lowest number is odd. What’s more, the Romans didn’t have to learn the collection of single-digit multiplications (e. g., 7 × 8 = 56) we do. They only had to know how to halve and double numbers and that’s easy to do in their system. Dirk Schlimm and Hansjörg Neth have done some experimental work comparing the cognitive work required to do a representative set of arithmetic operations in both the Roman and Hindu-Arabic systems.40 They must account for all the work it takes to do an operation for a large set of sample problems. Here is an example. Let’s look at the start of the cogni- tive work to do 54 + 68. I would first fix my attention on the digit 8 in 68 and store it in my working memory. Then I would attend to the digit 4 in 54 and store it. Then I would search for the answer to 8 + 4 in my LTM and this gives 12. They assume that their virtual arithme- tic agents have a place to record the answer as it’s developed, much as we would if we were using a pencil and paper. Hence, to deal with 12, I would write the 2 in one place and the 1 in another where I stored carried digits. Their cognition audit continues in this way with the recording of all reads, attention changes, and LTM searches. The experiments record all of the cognitive effort to do 1,000,000 additions of the form x + y + z for x,y,z between 1 and 100. I won’t go over all of their experimental results, but there are three measures which tell most of the story: the Total Number of Symbols used, the Total Reads (you look at a symbol and store it) and the Total Attention Shifts (you change your attention from one symbol to the next). These measures are presented in the following table for both systems: Total Number of Symbols Total Reads Total Attention Shifts Hindu-Arabic Roman 5,760 15,032 8,116 244,166 16,625 336,413 The table numbers are in units of 1,000 (the element 5,760 is actually 5,760,000). Looking first at the Total Number of Symbols, the Roman measure is almost three times as large. It’s easy to see why by looking at some simple additions. Here is the one I looked at above: LXVII (67) + CLXXXVI (186) = CCLIII (253). 40 Dirk Schlimm and Hansjörg Neth, “Modeling Ancient and Modern Arithmetic Practices: Addition and Multiplication with Arabic and Roman Numerals,” in Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, eds B. C. Love, K. McRae, & V. M. Sloutsky (Austin: Cognitive Science Society, 2008). Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 331 There are 18 individual Roman symbols but only 8 Hindu-Arabic symbols. For the next two measures (Total Reads and Total Attention Shifts), the Roman measures are staggeringly larger. These are explained by the higher number of symbols the Roman system requires, but the nature of the additive Roman system is also a factor. Just based on these three measures, it would appear the Hindu-Arabic system is better. However the Hindu-Arabic system requires more effort to learn. As with multiplication, we need to store a set of single-digit additions (e. g., 6 + 8 = 14) in our LTMs whereas with Roman addition, you don’t. The other important thing to understand about arithmetic in any sophisticated number system is that, to do it, we need to engage our hands and some sort of external cognitive resource. For example, to compute 386 × 459 in the Hindu-Arabic system, you need a pencil and paper, or a calculator, or a computer. In medieval Europe, the equivalent Roman calcula- tion would require a counting board or an abacus and both were easy to learn. In fact, the counting board and abacus can be used to do Hindu-Arabic arithmetic and were used exten- sively once the Hindu-Arabic system replaced the Roman system. The important takeaway from the Schlimm-Neth experiments is that a human armed with an abacus or counting board is able to do arithmetic calculations more quickly using the Hindu-Arabic system. There is no question that the same computation is possible using the Roman system but it’s just not as efficient. However, the Roman system was in Europe first With . . . exographic systems that’s an advantage. So what happened? Michael Chatfield summarizes what we know: Taken as a whole, the Roman accounting legacy to the Middle Ages was tenacious but of doubtful value. The preference for Roman numerals continued among bookkeepers until the sixteenth century, hundreds of years after the introduction of Arabic numbers.41 John Durham confirms the lead taken by the academic sector: “There is little doubt that “Arabic” numerals were well-known to academic circles by the eleventh century.”42 The evidence I was able to find is consistent with these assessments. I checked The Doomsday Book, the colossal demographic and economic survey of England and Wales completed by the court officials of William the Conqueror in 1086 CE. It’s written in Latin and all the numbers are Roman numerals. I then looked at the published work of a number of the early scientists in the coming Scientific Revolution including Tycho Brahe (1546–1601 CE), Johannes Kepler (1571–1630 CE), Copernicus (1473–1543 CE), and William Gilbert (1544–1603 CE). All used Hindu-Arabic numerals. There is some evidence that Gerbert of Aurillac (946–1003 CE) was the first to introduce Hindu-Arabic numerals to European 41 Michael Chatfield, A History of Accounting Thought (Hinsdale, Illinois: The Dryden Press, 1974), 16. 42 John Durham, “The Introduction of “Arabic” Numerals in European Accounting,” The Accounting Historians Journal 19, no. 2, (1992): 26. 332 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe education. The real push came from Leonardo of Pisa (“Fibonacci”, 1170–1250 CE) with his publication of Liber Abaci in 1202 CE. He begins it this way: These are the nine figures of the Indians 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. And so, with these nine figures, and with the symbol 0, which is called zephyr in Arabic, whatever number you please can be written, as is demonstrated below. And once the numbers are introduced, he then demonstrates how Hindu-Arabic arithmetic worked. It’s worth pausing for a moment to consider the genius of the Hindu-Arabic system. With a scant 10 symbols, we can represent an infinite set of numbers. As I have already explained, written language also has this combinatorial property. With just 26 letters we can spin ideas of amazing complexity. John Durham suggests that the use of Hindu-Arabic numbers commercially was likely an Italian innovation of the 14th century. Within this commercial sector, Roman numerals persisted well into the 16th century. So the switch to Hindu-Arabic numbers did not occur overnight. It was a slow process that took centuries. Let’s now try to see why. As I pointed out earlier in this chapter, we know that Europe underwent a considerable economic and social transformation between 1,000 CE and 1,500 CE. Through the early Middle Ages, Europe was basically an agrarian society assembled around small villages. Exchange was largely barter. After 1,000 CE, agricultural production expanded considerably due to climate change and a number of technological innovations including wind and hydro- powered grain mills and other processes, the wheeled carruca plough pulled by shoed horses rather than oxen, and a shift from a two-field to three-field rotation of crops. These all served to make agriculture much more productive. It’s worth making another parenthetic note. Much of this book is about abstract ideation. But as I have pointed out, there is also concrete ideation, ideation that does not require exo- graphics. All of the improvements to agriculture in medieval Europe were concrete innova- tions which contributed to a substantial cultural change. Historically, as this agricultural expansion continued, the towns and cities grew in popu- lation and trade among them and the Arab cities of the eastern Mediterranean increased significantly. This expansion of trade encouraged the rise of a merchant class, a growth in the money supply and a movement away from barter to an exchange economy. Clearly economic activity had expanded considerably and this led to a substantial increase in the computation required to support exchange. Alongside this growth in the merchant class, there was a need for apprentices to learn commercial arithmetic. This was done by reckoning masters at Reckoning Schools, located in the cities and along the trade routes. Frank Swetz reports that, by 1338, there were 6 Reckoning Schools in Florence alone.43 The curricula at these schools were based on the 43 Frank Swetz, Capitalism and Arithmetic: The New Math of the 15th Century (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Publishing Company, 1987), 17. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 333 Hindu-Arabic System including the representation of numbers, the arithmetic operations on these numbers, and the commercial application of arithmetic. One of the extant arithmetic texts of the 15th century is the Treviso Arithmetic. It was published in 1478 in Treviso by an anonymous author. It is a Hindu-Arabic System text with lots of commercial applications. Here is one: If 100 pounds of ginger are worth 16 ducats, 18 grossi, 14 pizoli and 1⁄2, what will 8564 pounds and 1/3 be worth.44 Here is another: A merchant has 10 marks and 6 ounces and 1⁄2 of silver of a fineness of 5 ounces and 1⁄2 per mark. He has 12 marks of another kind which contains 6 ounces and 1⁄2 per mark. He has 15 marks of another kind which has fineness of 7 ounces and 1⁄4 per mark. And from all of this silver, he wishes to coin money which shall contain 4 ounces and 3⁄4 of fineness per mark. Required is to know the amount in the mixture, and how much brass must be added.45 These problems are a clear indication that commercial transactions and calculations were not trivial (especially if you were just learning the Hindu-Arabic system). Additionally trade among the cities was complicated by the fact that each city had its own currency so exchange calculations were involved in all transactions between merchants of different cities. Over the first centuries of the Renaissance, pressure was building to move to the Hindu- Arabic system. One advantage was that detailed commercial calculations could be recorded in pen and ink, whereas it was only possible to record the final answer when an abacus was used for a Roman system calculation. Another advantage of the Hindu-Arabic system was that it was easier to deal with fractions and these came up frequently in currency exchange calculations. In addition to these two advantages, the Schlimm-Neth experimental work described above makes it quite obvious that any calculation could be done more quickly using the Hindu-Arabic system on a counting board or abacus. As we now know, that change happened but it certainly wasn’t a sudden change. This is a testament to the robustness of the Roman system, a system that was certainly adequate to support the Roman Empire and European trade for a millennium after Rome fell. Other explanations have been offered. Some have suggested that the innovation of dou- ble-entry bookkeeping facilitated the move to Hindu-Arabic numbers. A number of research- ers have argued that Roman numerals persisted long after the emergence of double-entry bookkeeping.46 Double-entry bookkeeping would certainly have favoured the Hindu-Arabic system. 44 Swetz, Capitalism and Arithmetic, 115. 45 Swetz, Capitalism and Arithmetic, 157. 46 Alan Sangster, “The Genesis of Double Entry Bookkeeping,” The Accounting Review 91, no. 1 (2016). 334 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe There is a more general lesson here. We have two exographic systems for representing the same information, the Roman system and the Hindu-Arabic system. They are informa- tionally equivalent. Clearly when it comes to manipulation and computation, the Hindu- Arabic system is superior. Hence not all informationally equivalent exographic systems are the same. The symbolic system used to represent ideas matters. 16.8 Copernicus The fascinating question is what prompted Copernicus to start thinking about the possibil- ity that, in the Lord’s design of the universe, the Earth was not stationary but instead moved around a stationary Sun? Let’s again put this in perspective. Ptolemy wrote the Almagest in 150 CE and it had survived for centuries. His universe was centered on a stationary Earth and this had made its way into Christian orthodoxy. Copernicus was a devote Christian, a canon in northern Poland, and distant from the centre of Christianity in Rome. What would cause him to start thinking about the possibility of the Earth moving? I take my direction from the work of Owen Gingerich, an American astronomer and an acknowledged expert on Copernicus’s life and contribution. Gingerich found that there was quite a bit of myth about what lead Copernicus to come up with his novel idea.47 Before dis- cussing those concerns, let’s review what astronomers were seeing in the sky and how they explained it. To an observer on Earth, the planets moved strangely. As I have already described, plan- ets were observed moving west to east, then suddenly a planet would stop and start moving back to the west and then, after a short period, stop and start again moving east. Ptolemy and subsequent astronomers used epicycles to explain this movement. To see how epicycles work, consider this diagram: 47 Owen Gingerich, “‘Crisis’ Versus Aesthetic in the Copernican Revolution,” Vistas in Astronomy 17, no. 1 (1975). Source: Based upon data from Thomas S. Kuhn, La rivoluzione copernicana. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 335 Imagine that a stationary Earth is at center of the larger circle. Let’s assume that a planet revolves around the smaller circle. The center of the smaller circle travels along the larger circle. At the same time, the planet is moving around the smaller circle. To an observer on Earth, the planet would appear to follow the path on which the small red circles sit. This shape of path is called an epicycle. Let’s take it further. Let’s start with the planet at the position numbered 1. It then moves to position 2, then 3, and then 4. Note that to go from 1 to 2 the planet is travelling west to east from the perspective of a viewer on Earth. But when it gets to 2, it seems to stop and start to head back to the west. When it gets to 3, it stops and starts to move again towards the east. So it’s possible to explain planetary motion with this epicycle model where the planet revolves around a point which is also rotating around the Earth. As described by Gingerich, the astronomers following Ptolemy had to use increasingly sophisticated epicycle models to explain the planetary motions they were observing. Accord- ing to Thomas Kuhn, author of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, this led to a crisis in astronomy and caused Copernicus to start to think about his heliocentric model.48 Gingerich challenges this narrative by arguing that there was simply no evidence of any sort of concern or crisis within the astronomy community at the time and he comes to this conclusion with a careful consideration of published research at the time. Another myth that Gingerich confronts is the tremendous modelling simplification pro- vided by Copernicus’s heliocentric model. The Copernican model still needed epicycles but only a few less than the best geocentric models. So there was really no staggering simplifica- tion in the heliocentric model. Next Gingerich looked at empirical data. He examined the forecast positions of planets using both models and finds about the same level of error with the Copernican model. Copernicus was aware of all these limitations of his model and so Gingerich properly asks what possessed Copernicus to put his model forward. Gingerich argues that it was aes- thetics. At the time, Copernicus wrote this: Therefore on long pondering this uncertainty of mathematical traditions on the deduction of the motions of the system of the spheres, I began to feel disgusted that no more certain theory of the motions of the mechanisms of the universe, which has been established for us by the best and most systematic craftsman of all, was agreed by the philosophers, who otherwise theorised so minutely with most careful attention to the details of this system. I therefore set myself the task of reading again the books of all philosophers which were available to me, to search out whether anyone had ever believed that the motions of the spheres of the universe were other than was supposed by those who professed mathematics in the schools.49 48 Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962). 49 This is taken from Copernicus’s letter to Pope Paul III, published in On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres in 1543 CE. 336 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe Quite simply, Copernicus was looking for a simpler model. He couldn’t believe that “the best and most systematic craftsman of all” would put something together as complicated as the geocentric model suggested. In other words, it was, in part, Copernicus’s Christian beliefs that caused him to pursue the heliocentric model. You can see this from the first paragraph of De Revolutionibus Orbium Cœlestium: First of all, we must note that the universe is spherical. The reason is either that, of all forms, the sphere is the most perfect, needing no joint and being a complete whole, which can be neither increased nor diminished; or that it is the most capacious of figures, best suited to enclose and retain all things; . . . Today, the “shape” of the universe is an empirical question. But to Copernicus, who believed the Lord created all things, it was a straightforward claim easily proved by appealing to the “perfection” of a spherical shape, one that for a given surface area, would enclose the most volume. Why would the Lord use any other shape? I think we can take it further. Copernicus was living in an age of unrest. In 1492 CE, Christopher Columbus had discovered America and, in so doing, had single-handedly destroyed Ptolemy’s map of the Earth. In 1500 CE, Gutenberg’s press was already 50 years old, diffusing quickly across Europe, and allowing printers to publish scientific work includ- ing all of the relevant research in astronomy. Martin Luther started his revolution in 1517 CE and by 1543 CE, when Copernicus finally published his model, the Reformation was well under way. Simply, the Church was beginning to lose the battle for the control of ideas. As others have suggested, Copernicus fired the first shot of the Scientific Revolution and in so doing helped to get scholars and others to Modernity where the focus was on looking ahead rather than back. 16.9 Modeling and War50 In his book The Measure of Reality, Alfred Crosby notes that Shakespeare, in Othello, has Iago disparage Cassio by remarking “Forsooth, a great arithmetician / One Michael Cassio, a Florentine / . . . / That never set a squadron in the field”.51 This reference to a soldier as an arithmetician was a simple recognition in the popular culture of the time that military offi- cers had to have some skill in mathematics in order to organize formations for battle. These formations tended to be regular shapes (squares, triangles, rectangles (“bastard squares”), etc.) and are direct descendants of the Greek phallanx and Roman legion, both regular in design. 50 This section is adapted from a paper by Jim Finan and me: W. J. Hurley and J. S. Finan, “Military Operations Research and Digges’s Stratioticos,” Military Operations Research 22, no. 2 (2017). 51 Alfred Crosby, The Measure of Reality: Quantification and Western Society, 1250-1600 (Cambridge, Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 1997). Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 337 A number of 16th century military textbooks detail problems of this kind. The general requirement was to determine how big a formation could be constructed for a given shape from a given number of troops. Here, I’ll detail the calculations taken from Thomas Digges’s (1515–1559 CE) book Stratioticos published in 1572 CE. Digges’s work was on the leading edge of the mathematics of the time. The use of algebra was beginning to diffuse across Europe. The algebra that came to Europe from the Greeks and Islamic mathematians, particularly al-Khwarizmi, was rhetorical in the sense that prob- lems where formulated and solved with words rather than symbols. When this technology arrived in Europe, mathematicians began to represent quantities and arithmetic operations with symbols. For instance, Renaissance Italian mathematics represented the unknown quan- tity with “cosa” and had specific symbols for the plus and minus sign among other math- ematical objects. In Stratioticos, Digges termed this symbolic algebra the “Rule of Cosse as the Italians terme it.” I’ll show how Digges used this algebra to arrive at formation sizes and composition for a given number of troops. In so doing, Digges brought to bear the best mathematics available at the time to solve his problems. We’ll begin with a brief overview of the use of regular battle formations over the history of war. The Importance of Regular Formation The use of regular military formations in battle is well known. Both the Greek phalanx and the Roman legion are cases in point. What may not be as familiar, however, is the reason why these kinds of geometrical formations were used. In antiquity, when fighting was mainly done by soldiers armed with a variety of swords, spears and other edged weapons, the use of geometrical forms (lines, columns, and squares) had both defensive and offensive utility. Geometric formations were, particularly in the offense, force multipliers. Generally, fighting in the Middle Ages in Europe after the fall of Rome used similar offensive and defensive formations albeit perhaps not as well as had been the case in antiquity. The sword and spear were still the principal weapons and close order formations were still central to effective fighting. These close order formations were vulnerable to techniques of “indirect fire” in the form of catapults of varying sizes and the arrows of archers. The Battle of Agincourt (1415 CE) in which French cavalry suffered heavily at the hands of English archers emphasized a trend that had begun to develop in the 14th century which was the gradual domination of cavalry by disciplined formations of infantry. European countries began to rely on the pike, the crossbow and eventually the arquebus as the weapons around which effective infantry formations could be built. Geometric formational fighting continued to be the core of infantry fighting into the early modern period. The most effective form of this type of fighting became dominant in the early 16th century in Spain. In this period, the Spanish fielded Europe’s most formidable fighting force. Its armies were based on a geometrical formation called the tercio which was a brigade sized formation of about 3,000 men. It was built around 12 smaller companies of 338 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe about 250 men who were evenly divided between pikemen and arqubusiers. This powder and pike combination would dominate warfare in the 16th and 17th centuries. It was made particularly effective by Gustavus Adolphus, the King of Sweden (1611–1632 CE) during the Thirty Years War (1618–1648 CE). The tactical need to combine pikes and powder into a force that delivered maximum offensive shock power was at the heart of European warfare. The movement from column into line, into square and back to column and/or square could only be achieved by soldiers who were highly trained in the complex drill and discipline upon which success in this “formational” warfare rested. Of equal importance was a clear understanding of the “numbers” required to adjust ranks and files quickly from one forma- tion to another. This was indeed warfare by the numbers. It is precisely this problem that is at issue in Digges’s Stratioticos. In Digges’s time, a fundamental challenge on the battlefield was the vulnerability of infantry to cavalry or other infantry units. Coherent heavy cavalry formations could read- ily destroy poorly disciplined infantry. At the same time, infantry mobility was frequently achieved at the cost of formational coherence which created significant battlefield vulner- abilities. Discipline expressed through disciplined formational warfare was crucial to infan- try survival and success both defensively and offensively. Weapons such as the crossbow and the arquebus had relatively little striking power alone or in small groups. However, in larger groups supported by pikemen, companies of crossbowmen and arquebusiers presented attacking cavalry and opposing infantry with a formidable mix of tactical destructive capa- bility. Formational problems of the type Digges solved allowed the integration of different weapon systems into an effective tactical whole. This was an early version of combined arms and manoeuvre warfare. Digges published Stratioticos in 1579 CE. In the 16th century, there was a succession of European battles and campaigns many of them involving Digges’s country England. There were dynastic wars in continental Europe that engaged England’s strategic interests; home- grown dynastic conflicts and a variety of rebellions. In England, there was The Rising of the North (1569–1570 CE) that pitted English Catholics and Protestants against each other. Simi- larly, rebellions in Ireland against English rule in the First Desmond Rebellion (1569–1573 CE) and the Second Desmond Rebellion (1579–1583 CE) are indicative of the atmosphere in which Digges was writing. The problem Digges considered was, in his time, not only an interesting intellectual concern but also a serious practical matter upon which the political fate of nations, his included, rested. The Design of Formations Here is Digges’s “The first Question” which begins Chapter 10: There is delivered to the Serieant-Maior 60 Ensignes, in every Ensigne 160 Pikes, and short weapon. The Generals pleasure is, that he shall put them into one mayne Squadrone, and to arm it rounde with seaven ranckes of Pikes, I demaund how Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 339 many Pikes, how manye Halberds, he shall use to make the greatest Squadrone, and howe many ranckes shall be in that Battayle. AB DC Digges begins his solution this way: For resolution of this demaund, first I set downe in Portrayte the forme of the Battalye here represented, by ABCD [see the figure above]. The Squadrone of short weapon EFGH. The residue representing the seaven Ranckes of the Armed Pikes. At the time, there were two types of foot-soldier: Pikes (and Halberds) armed with very long spears (and in the case of Halberds, a spear/axe combination) and those armed with swords and daggers which Digges refers to as “short weapon.” So it is the General’s wish to put the Pikes in 7 ranks exterior to the “short weapon” soldiers located within EFGH. In all, the Seri- ant Maior (SM) has 60 Ensignes × 160 Soldiers/Ensigne = 9600 soldiers. It’s the SM’s job to assign these soldiers as either Pikes/Halberds or “short weapon”. This is easily solved with modern mathematics. Let x be the length of each side of the outer square ABCD measured as the number of soldiers. Then the total number of soldiers is x2. We wish to find the largest x such that x2 ≤ 9600. We have that 9600 = 97.98 so each side should have a length of 97 soldiers. Each side of the square EFGH has length x−7−7=97−14=83andthereforethenumberofshortweaponsoldiersis832 =6889. Therefore, the number of Pikes is 9600 – 6883 = 2711. This is also the solution Digges finds and he arrives at it in much the same way. Models and Their Solution One of the great advances across many disciplines is the translation of a real-world problem into a mathematical model. Once this is done, the modeler needs a method to solve the model which is sometimes not easy. In the fifty years preceding the publication of the Stratioticos, the techniques for representing and solving equations improved considerably. Based on my assessment, it appears that Digges was current with these methods and used them in the Stratioticos. The step of representing an unknown number by a symbol (algebra) was a difficult- cognitive hurdle. It dates at least to the work of the Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi EF GH © Kendall Hunt Publishing Company 340 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe (780–850 CE) whose noteworthy book on the solution of linear and quadratic equations contained the word “al-jabr” in its title. There is some debate about the meaning of al-jabr, but the most reasonable is “restoration.” In the context of algebra and modelling, this makes sense because an unknown number is carried through a problem as a symbol and the value of the symbol is only revealed or “restored” at the end of the procedure. As we remarked in the introduction, algebra was done rhetorically well into the 15th century meaning that problems were stated and solutions were presented in words and sentences. It was only when algebra reached Europe that things started to change. Fibonacci (1170–1250 CE) saw the value of a more efficient representation of symbols and operations and used them in his book Liber Abaci (Book of Calculation, 1202 CE). The Italians used the term “cosa” to represent the unknown in a problem and, later, English mathematicians referred to these as Cossike numbers. Back then mathematicians did not use the same manipulations we use today to solve equations. We’ll illustrate with the work of Adam Ries (1492–1559 CE), a German arithme- tician who made his living as a bookkeeper for a mining company. He wrote a number of remarkable books on arithmetic. His first, “Rechnung auff der linihen,” explained how to do Roman numeral arithmetic on a board similar to an abacus. In his second, “Rechenung auff der linihen und Federn,” he described how to make calculations with Hindu-Arabic numbers. This was at about the same time that the decimal system was starting to replace the Roman numeral system. In this second book, Ries also presents some problems from recreational mathematics, among these the following: A passer-by encounters a group of people and says, ‘Greetings, thirty companions.’ One of them replies, ‘If we were as many again and half as many, we would be thirty altogether.’ The problem is to figure out how many people there were. With the tools we now have available, this is an easy problem. Let the number of people be represented by x. The information in the question requires that x must satisfy x + x + 2x = 30 or 52 x = 30 and the solution is x = 12. These simple manipulations were unknown to Ries and other 15th century mathemati- cians. Nonetheless, they were able to solve it using a technique termed the Method of False Position (Regula Falsi) which dates to the Rhind Papyrus (Egypt, 17th century BC) and was known to Babylonian mathematicians. Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 341 It worked like this. First, an arbitrary trial solution is selected, say 16 people. Evaluating the left-hand side of the first equation with this solution, we have 16 + 16 + 8 = 40 which is 10 more than 30. The next step is to try a second solution, say, 10. This gives a total of 10 + 10 + 5 = 25 people, which is too few. To summarize, we have two trials and two errors: Trial Error 16 10 10 5 where one of the trials results in an error above 30 and one below 30. We can now get the answer by cross-multiplying the Trial and Error values 16 × 5 + 10 × 10 = 180 and then dividing the result, 180, by the sum of the errors: 180 =12 10+5 which is the correct answer. The Method of False Position made its way to Europe through the work of Fibonacci. Petrus Apianus (also known as Bienewitz) introduced the Latin name Reguli Falsi in his Latin translation of the method in 1527 CE. He summarized the method as one which “learns to produce truth from two lies.” Today, we know the Method of False Position as a secant method and it is well known that it will solve a linear equation exactly. What is remarkable is that mathematicians going back to antiquity had been able to solve linear equations without the modern machinery of algebra. Robert Recorde and the Solution of Equations by “Strange Position” The representation of equations and unknowns as we know them today begins with the work of Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde (1512–1558 CE) who details his approach in his book The Wetstone of Witte (1557 CE). This is a remarkable development of arithmetic and algebra given as a Socratic dialogue between a Master (teacher) and Scholar (student). In it, he invented the equals sign (“I will sette as I doe .. a paire of paralleles .. bicause noe .2. thyn- ges, can be moare equalle”) as well as introduced the “+” and “−” signs to English speakers. In fact, his first equation looked like this: 342 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe and, to our knowledge, it’s the first equation in recorded history using an equals sign. The symbol to the right of 14 is an unknown “roote”. Note the oversized plus sign and the over- sized equals sign. The symbols to the right of 15 and 71 indicate that these are just numbers. In modern syntax, this is the equation 14x + 15 = 71. Of the unknown, Recorde writes this . . . it mai bee thoughte to bee a rule of wonderful invention that teacheth a manne at the firste worde to name a true number before he knoweth resolutely [surely] what he hath named. But bicause that name is common to many nombers [although not in a specific question] and therefore the name is obscure till the worke doe detect it, I thinke this rule might well bee called the rule of dark position, or of strange position, but not false position. Here he contrasts his approach to the Rule of False Position and well he should for just under his presentation of the equation he explains how you can subtract 15 from each side of the equals sign (i. e. the 14x + 15 and the 71) to arrive at or 14x + 15 − 15 = 71 − 15 14x = 56 and “then by reduction,” x = 4. That is clearly the method we would use today and it is surely easier to use than the Method of False Position. Digges uses exactly the same calculus in the Stratioticos. In his rule “Of transporting of numbers in Aequations,” he writes “This is a Rule generall, everie number transposed changeth his signe, as if I say 10x + 4 are equal to 3x3, I may transfer 4 to 3x3 and say 10x are equal to 3x3 − 4.” Digges also has a rule “Of Reduction of the part of an Aequation.” For this rule he states that if the original equation is 3x3 = 12x2 − 9x, he can divide by 3x to arrive at x2 = 4x− 3. Digges goes on to show a number of these manipulations, ones that we are familiar with today to solve equations. To solve quadratic equations, he completes the square, a technique known to the Baby- lonians. Even though he uses this rule, there is no sense in which he justifies it. He simply states it and shows how to use it. Summary Beginning in the Middle East and then to Europe, we managed to invent algebra, the idea of naming a number before you know what the number is. That’s a remarkable step that leads to equations (and their solutions), inequalities (and their solutions), and then modeling, the idea of representing a real-world problem with mathematics and then getting insight about Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 343 the problem with the model solution. We saw this with Digges showing how to construct a military formation of a particular shape given the number of soldiers available. 16.10 Summary Most modern observers see the Middle Ages as a period where it was a possibility that civi- lization would not survive. Almost overnight, we went from the high culture of the Roman Empire to a Europe of piecemeal waring tribes. Some commentators, most notably Kenneth Clark, have suggested that civilization had a near death experience. The view from outside Europe at the time was not hopeful. I’ve already described the views of the Muslim geogra- pher Al-Masudi (896–956 CE) about the people of Europe around the turn of the millennium: As regards the people of the northern quadrant, they are the ones for whom the sun is distant from the zenith, as they penetrate to the north, such as the Slavs, the Franks, and those nations that are their neighbors. . . . The warm humor is lacking among them; their bodies are large, their natures gross, their manners harsh, their understanding dull, and their tongues heavy. . . . The farther they are to the north the more stupid, gross, and brutish they are.52 From what I’ve been able to glean from the history of ideas, education, and exographic technology change, Europe made phenomenal progress over the Middle Ages. We arrived at Modernity and, as the 17th century opened, our mining of the A Class began to quicken considerably. In my view the history of the Middle Ages is one of great progress. Of course, there remains the question of explaining the triumph. Let’s summarize my explanation. The story of medieval ideas begins with Christianity and the Church. Christianity became the religion of the Roman Empire and was attractive enough that it quickly spread across Europe. As we’ve seen, Christianity was one of Brian Stock’s textual communities. It was centered on the Bible, and therefore literacy was important. Literacy was also impor- tant in the management of the Church. The Church was the largest political organization in Europe over the history of the Middle Ages and, as we’ve seen, any large bureaucracy runs on literacy. The Church was all powerful as the 16th century opened. But cracks were beginning to form and in 1517 CE, Luther nailed his theses to the cathedral door. The Reformation had begun and, with it, the authority of the Church of Rome was considerably weakened. As we’ve seen, the nature of Luther’s Protestantism encouraged literacy and men had more free- dom to interpret the Bible. After the Peace of Westphalia, the Church’s authority in the world of ideas disappeared. Basically, no idea was off limits. Copernicus was concerned about publishing his idea of a heliocentric universe. Galileo, his main cheerleader, got into terrible 52 Reported in: Bernard Lewis, The Muslim Discovery of Europe (New York: Norton, 2001), 139. 344 Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe difficulty, almost paying with his life. But when Darwin suggested that we had evolved from small-headed monkeys, the reception accorded his ideas was gentler by comparison. Religion no longer held sway over ideas. We also made progress in the technology of exographics, going from stylus, papyrus, and rolls to quills, parchment, paper, and the codex. At the top of this list, however, was Guten- berg’s innovative ideas of moveable type and the printing press. Even though the Chinese had invented both long before, Gutenberg was able to innovate a technology that was perfect for taking a phonetic language like Latin (and the various vernaculars) and bringing it to the printed page. The printing press quickly diffused and with it, book production soared. In 1450 CE, Europe was ready for the book. An essential input for the A Class is education. Very early in medieval Europe, monas- tic and chancery schools carried the load in literacy education. After the turn of the mil- lennium, private schools were also added. The most important development in medieval education was the university. The first few in the 12th century grew to 182 at the close of the 17th century. Higher education had arrived. The early universities were dominated by oral exchange between teaching masters and students but around the time of the Protestant Ref- ormation, there was a gradual switch to an exographic medium, and today, universities are producing a large quantity of A Class ideas. The explosive growth in A Class ideas began in the late medieval period. With the arrival of Modernity, we see, in quick succession, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. As I have documented in these last sections, we accomplished great advances in music and mathematics. In music, beginning with the innovation of staff notation, composers were able to arrange polyphony of stunning complexity and beauty. In mathematics, the Hindu-Arabic numbers supplanted the Roman system, and eventually alge- bra and modeling diffused across Europe and particularly the universities. It’s very hard not to be impressed with A Class growth in medieval Europe. We were doing all the right things. We improved our exographic technologies. The education systems were sufficient to produce scholars who would generate significant new A Class ideas. In summary, educated, socially-constructed imaginations employed enhanced exographics to mine a substantial increase in A Class ideas.","length":113730,"tokens":25329,"chunks":[{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"Dust, worms, and ashes now    Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved, Pray, reader, for my soul.

Europe went from the ongoing cultural advance of Rome to a loose collection of tribes and kingdoms with nowhere near the ideation potential. In fact, some have argued that European civilization had a near-death experience over the two to three centuries after the fall of Rome.1 Now, let’s flash forward about a thousand years.

What both identify is the writing done in support of commercial transactions. Private property had been in existence stretching back to antiquity.

As it turns out, it was an attractive religion based on some important features including a forgiving, loving God, and eternal salvation. After some very difficult times at the hands of the Romans, things turned around. In 313 CE, with the Edict of Milan, the emperor Constantine made Christianity one of the Empire’s offi- cial religions and in 380 CE, the emperor Theodosius made it the Empire’s official religion.

One of the first guides for monastic life, The Rule of Augustine, was written by St. Augustine in about 400 CE.

One of the important concepts that Brian Stock presents in The Implications of Literacy is the notion of a textual community. Roughly, a textual community is one where the think- ing, values, self-image, and relations with others outside the community, are guided by an authoritative, fundamental text. It is a literate way of life where those in authority teach and interpret the text. The rest undergo a literate education and socialization process with their peers. A good example of a textual community is a monastery where the literate senior monks teach novices. The authoritative text is the Bible and other texts seek to interpret and educate. Gregory the Great (540–604 CE) played an integral role in requiring the monasteries to take on the role of book preservation and production. Almost all medieval monaster- ies had a scriptorium where monks would work on copying manuscripts.

In medi- eval times, a primary vehicle for the evaluation of university students was the disputation where a student, under strict process rules, was charged with defending an assigned question. Effectively, they were debates where participants, including the student, were trying to get at the truth.

Sometimes they went as far as promising that souls already in hell could get to heaven.14 Often, the proceeds of indulgences were used to finance church construction.

Going back to the manuscript Vergilius Vaticanus, what jumps out at a modern reader is that there are no spaces between the words. This is termed scriptio continua and it was stan- dard practise until Irish monks began to insert spaces between words in the 7th century CE.17 In addition, there are no small letters, just capital letters.

Normally, if a technology like the codex is going to disrupt a well-established technology like the scroll, it has to have some significant advantages in order to get manuscript producers to change. In the case of the codex, what were these advantages? A codex would be cheaper to produce because not as much material was required since you can write on both sides of the page. Because a codex requires less page material, it would store more compactly. It would be easier to locate and get to specific points in a codex because you can flip a large number pages easily, whereas, with a scroll, you have to roll your way through all of the intervening pages.

Changes in Media Over the millennia, we’ve inscribed a variety of media. Papyrus was the medium of choice for thousands of years. Over time, as the papyrus plant became scarcer, we went to parch- ment, a material made from sheep and calfskin.21 To make a sheet of parchment, the skin (with the hair attached) was soaked in a lime solution for a period of three to ten days depend- ing on temperature. They were then washed with water.

Finally, both surfaces were rubbed with chalk to whiten and smooth the surface. This is pure C Class ideation that took took centuries to perfect. The Chinese were the first to make paper out of rags in antiquity. The technique diffused through trade to the Middle East about the 8th century CE and then made its way to western Europe about 12th century CE.

A New Inscribing Technology: The Printing Press The Chinese were the first to invent the printing press in about 250 BCE. Basically, they used inscribed wooden blocks. They were also the first to invent moveable type in about 1045 CE. In northern Europe, over the period 1440–1450 CE, Johannes Gutenberg innovated (indepen- dently we think) a printing press and moveable type. Gutenberg’s contribution was to produce a small rectangular piece of metal with a par- ticular letter raised on the surface of one end.

He was a goldsmith by training so had the expertise to come up with such a process. His method yielded a large number of identical pieces of type for each letter. Once these pieces were made, they could be moved around very quickly in a form depending on what was being printed. The form was inked and, with the press, a blank page and the form were brought together to produce a page of text. Before this, presses had a woodblock form: basically, the block was inked and then paper was pressed against it to obtain a printed page. The problem was that the blocks were dif- ficult to make and not easy to change. Gutenberg’s great contribution was the development of a process to produce type that was easily assembled into forms. Once work was finished with the form for a particular page, the same pieces could be used to assemble another form for the next page.","content_length":932,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"With Gutenberg’s system, mistakes could be fixed easily.

In 1452, Cardinal Estoutville eliminated the strict rules banning note taking at the University of Paris. He also argued that teaching masters had to lecture in such a fashion as to allow students to take notes, although it appears he left the choice open to the individual lecturers, permitting both types of lecturing.34 This prohibition on note-taking supported the belief that students’ minds were strengthened if they didn’t take notes.","content_length":946,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"Note-taking, as their argument went, would undermine and weaken the strength and quickness of mind that purely oral learning developed.

There were usually two student participants even though only one was being tested, and their debate, usually along a strict set of procedural rules, was mediated by the teach- ing master, effectively the advisor of the student being tested. Teaching masters were also expected to take part in their own disputations. These were usually open to the public and held on holidays and feast days.

Richard Taruskin writes about the importance of this change: Something over a thousand years ago music in the West stopped being (with negligible exceptions) an exclusively oral tradition and became a partly literate one. This was, from our perspective, an enormously important change. The beginning of music writing gives us access through actual musical documents to the repertories of the past and suddenly raises the curtain, so to speak, on developments that had been going on for centuries.

Certainly written music has gotten more complex since the tenth century CE. Here is a snippet of exographics for an early Gregorian chant: 36 Richard Taruskin, The Oxford History of Western Music.

Contrast that with modern music notation: This modern notation allows composers to construct polyphony where players in an orchestra or choir will play different parts. It’s a step up from the monophony of Gregorian chant. To understand polyphony, we first need to understand the general structure of music exographics. Here is a snippet of modern music notation: Note that there are 5 lines and 4 spaces between. This set of lines and spaces are termed the staff or stave. Essentially this notation captures a number of dimensions of the music. There is a vertical dimension: notes placed higher on the staff have higher tones or pitches. The second dimension is the horizontal dimension and it specifies the order the notes are to be played.

It is difficult to imagine how something like The Four Seasons could be imagined without exographics support. It would have been impossible for Vivaldi to keep track of all parts of the piece in his mind. Hence, like mathematics, some kinds of music would be impossible to compose without exographics.

Summary The history of composition in music is the story of the synthesis of two kinds of innovation. One is the evolution of music exographics. The other is the composition of the music itself. Our current exographics system, developed over a long period of time and based on different Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 329 note shapes superimposed on staff notation, captures the essential three dimensions of music (the notes, their order, and the rhythm) In turn, this evolving representational system has enabled us to compose polyphony of astonishing complexity and beauty.","content_length":914,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"Setting aside composition for the moment, it’s worth noting that exographics enables the coordination of large ensembles.

For example, to determine what number LXVII is, we simply add the values: 50 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 67.

Let’s now try to see why. As I pointed out earlier in this chapter, we know that Europe underwent a considerable economic and social transformation between 1,000 CE and 1,500 CE. Through the early Middle Ages, Europe was basically an agrarian society assembled around small villages. Exchange was largely barter. After 1,000 CE, agricultural production expanded considerably due to climate change and a number of technological innovations including wind and hydro- powered grain mills and other processes, the wheeled carruca plough pulled by shoed horses rather than oxen, and a shift from a two-field to three-field rotation of crops.","content_length":951,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"These all served to make agriculture much more productive.

Historically, as this agricultural expansion continued, the towns and cities grew in popu- lation and trade among them and the Arab cities of the eastern Mediterranean increased significantly. This expansion of trade encouraged the rise of a merchant class, a growth in the money supply and a movement away from barter to an exchange economy.

Let’s again put this in perspective. Ptolemy wrote the Almagest in 150 CE and it had survived for centuries. His universe was centered on a stationary Earth and this had made its way into Christian orthodoxy. Copernicus was a devote Christian, a canon in northern Poland, and distant from the centre of Christianity in Rome.","content_length":810,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"What would cause him to start thinking about the possibility of the Earth moving? I take my direction from the work of Owen Gingerich, an American astronomer and an acknowledged expert on Copernicus’s life and contribution. Gingerich found that there was quite a bit of myth about what lead Copernicus to come up with his novel idea.47 Before dis- cussing those concerns, let’s review what astronomers were seeing in the sky and how they explained it. To an observer on Earth, the planets moved strangely. As I have already described, plan- ets were observed moving west to east, then suddenly a planet would stop and start moving back to the west and then, after a short period, stop and start again moving east. Ptolemy and subsequent astronomers used epicycles to explain this movement.","content_length":789,"content_tokens":170,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"To see how epicycles work, consider this diagram: 47 Owen Gingerich, “‘Crisis’ Versus Aesthetic in the Copernican Revolution,” Vistas in Astronomy 17, no. 1 (1975) Source: Based upon data from Thomas S.

Let’s assume that a planet revolves around the smaller circle. The center of the smaller circle travels along the larger circle. At the same time, the planet is moving around the smaller circle. To an observer on Earth, the planet would appear to follow the path on which the small red circles sit. This shape of path is called an epicycle. Let’s take it further.

When it gets to 3, it stops and starts to move again towards the east. So it’s possible to explain planetary motion with this epicycle model where the planet revolves around a point which is also rotating around the Earth.

Another myth that Gingerich confronts is the tremendous modelling simplification pro- vided by Copernicus’s heliocentric model. The Copernican model still needed epicycles but only a few less than the best geocentric models. So there was really no staggering simplifica- tion in the heliocentric model.

Geometric formations were, particularly in the offense, force multipliers.

Geometric formational fighting continued to be the core of infantry fighting into the early modern period. The most effective form of this type of fighting became dominant in the early 16th century in Spain. In this period, the Spanish fielded Europe’s most formidable fighting force.

At the same time, infantry mobility was frequently achieved at the cost of formational coherence which created significant battlefield vulner- abilities.

Models and Their Solution One of the great advances across many disciplines is the translation of a real-world problem into a mathematical model.

The step of representing an unknown number by a symbol (algebra) was a difficult- cognitive hurdle.

There is some debate about the meaning of al-jabr, but the most reasonable is “restoration.” In the context of algebra and modelling, this makes sense because an unknown number is carried through a problem as a symbol and the value of the symbol is only revealed or “restored” at the end of the procedure.","content_length":822,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe","content":"As we remarked in the introduction, algebra was done rhetorically well into the 15th century meaning that problems were stated and solutions were presented in words and sentences.

Back then mathematicians did not use the same manipulations we use today to solve equations.

In this second book, Ries also presents some problems from recreational mathematics, among these the following: A passer-by encounters a group of people and says, ‘Greetings, thirty companions.’ One of them replies, ‘If we were as many again and half as many, we would be thirty altogether.’ The problem is to figure out how many people there were.

Chapter 16 Exographics and the Drive to Modernity in Europe 341 It worked like this. First, an arbitrary trial solution is selected, say 16 people.

The Method of False Position made its way to Europe through the work of Fibonacci. Petrus Apianus (also known as Bienewitz) introduced the Latin name Reguli Falsi in his Latin translation of the method in 1527 CE.

The story of medieval ideas begins with Christianity and the Church. Christianity became the religion of the Roman Empire and was attractive enough that it quickly spread across Europe. As we’ve seen, Christianity was one of Brian Stock’s textual communities. It was centered on the Bible, and therefore literacy was important. Literacy was also impor- tant in the management of the Church.

The printing press quickly diffused and with it, book production soared. In 1450 CE, Europe was ready for the book. An essential input for the A Class is education.

Marcus Aurelius Sometimes we take my breath away. ITER (“The Way” in Latin) is the international collaborative project to bring fusion power to the world. It launched in 1985 with partners China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States. As I’ve already discussed, fusion is our attempt to replicate the reaction at the center of stars, which powers the universe. Thousands of scientists and engineers have worked on the problem and we’ve spent US $20 billion just on ITER. We’ve made great progress but we’re not there yet. This is the toughest problem humanity has ever tackled and it will take many more good ideas to get there. The inner chamber of ITER looks like this: 345 Marko Aliaksandr 346 Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts This isn’t the inner workings of an alien spacecraft, but rather human handiwork. We’ve come a long way when you consider that, some 4 million years ago, our ancestors were a small-headed bipedal ape. Before that, about 4 billion years ago, the Earth was uninhabit- able, a spinoff of the gases and dust which formed the Sun. How do you go from the dust of burnt-out stars to a living species capable of this kind of thought? I haven’t provided a full answer to that question here. In fact, I’ve made only a small contribution which is to highlight the important role exographics plays in getting to A Class ideas. What I’d like to do in this final chapter is review the important developments that got us to the A Class and then indicate where I think our ideation is headed in the future. It all begins with our imaginations, this facility we have to “see” alternate futures and then make some of those futures happen. The first evidence of it goes back to our ancient ancestors who chipped stone to make tools. They imagined a tool which enabled them to do things more easily. Butchering a carcass is easier if you have a stone with a sharp edge to cut meat. Using a large stone to break a bone gave our ancestors access to the marrow so rich in protein and other nutrients. Flash forward to the present and we are now attempting to replicate the fusion reaction which powers the Sun. It’s many times more complicated than chipping stone to make tools but the principles are the same: our imaginations fuel the diaconatic steps to move forward. A lot had to go right in our evolutionary development to get to these imaginations. Likely as a result of climate change, we rose to bipedal movement which had a number of benefits. First, it took decidedly less energy to move, and second, it freed our hands to do other things. Chief among these is tool-making and thinking. Our hands evolved from those essential for arboreal movement to being useful for grasping weapons and tools. Relative to other primates, we developed a much larger opposable thumb and this enabled us to grasp and use tools. Along with form, our hands have become incredibly dextrous (in this regard, think concert pianist, surgeon, or Sidney Crosby). The fossil evidence supports the view that our ability to alter our environments with these new tools and other cultural achievements has changed our evolutionary path. Our discovery of cooking led to diets which were much easier to digest and took much less time and energy to eat. A chimpanzee will chew raw food for the better part of six hours a day. As a result of cooking, it now takes us minutes to prepare and eat food, and our apparatus for digestion (teeth, jaw, gut) became much smaller. This is striking evidence of the effect of culture on our biology. Consequently, we have two forces acting on us: the biological force of evolution through our genes and the cultural force of our ideation through our thinking. 17.1 The Power of Collaboration A key feature of this cultural force playing gently but forcefully in the background is our mind-sharing and collaborative ability. This ability likely has its origin in the hunt and goes back millions of years. Certainly, each of us has evolved an ability to imagine and then work with our hands to bring a cultural idea to the fore but what really magni- fies this individual ability is our mind-sharing and cooperative efforts. It gives us such things as the ITER in its present state, the International Space Station, and the iPhone. Not one of us individually is capable of any of these ideas. Together we can do other- worldly things. This is also true of some of our ideas that we generally attribute to an individual. Con- sider for a moment Bach’s Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring. We tend to think of it as the mag- nificent work of an individual genius. And it is. However there is also a sense in which it’s a creation enabled by a significant mind-sharing cultural network. Let me argue it this way. All of the instruments used within the orchestra have under- gone a long development. For example, consider the violin. The earliest stringed instru- ments go back at least to the Greek lyre. Bowed stringed instruments have their origin in the equestrian cultures of Central Asia. The first violins are usually associated with the Renais- sance in 15th-century Italy. So you can see that the path to the violin and its subsequent development can be traced over thousands of years. The development of wind instruments follows a similar path. Orchestras have their origin in Greek drama. The etymology of the word comes from the Greek word “orkhestra” denoting the location of the chorus usually at the front of the staging area. Their development continues from Rome to the Renaissance and Claudio Moneverdi (1567–1643 CE) who originated an orchestra with each instru- ment’s part mapped out on paper. I’ve already discussed the role of exographics and staff notation in the design and execution of complex polyphonic music. This is also done with the arrangement of the voices in the choir. Each part in the choir is mapped out exographi- cally. Finally, when I listen to this piece, I enjoy the YouTube recording featuring the St Martin-in-the-Fields orchestra and the Choir of Kings College, Cambridge. This recording technology has its origin in the work of Thomas Edison (1847–1931 CE), computer technol- ogy, and software development. When I want to listen to this selection, I simply type “Jesu” into the YouTube search line and my favourite recording is the first entry. Bach himself was born into a musical family in baroque-era Germany and, from an early age, was tutored in all aspects of the music of his era. With this discussion, it should be clear that Bach’s ide- ation occurred within a musical culture which had been developing for thousands of years. So, yes, we needed Bach to do the composition but he did his work within a vast cultural network. Genius is both individual and social. Of all the tools we’ve developed, surely the most useful for cultural collaboration are our symbolic skills: speech and exographics. Each allows us to share our ideas with pre- cision and depth. Both skills are so deeply engrained that we barely give them a second thought. Think about how utterly magical speech is. We can project a sequence of sounds toward another person. The fundamental components of that sequence, phonemes, are individually meaningless, but in sequence they are meaningful. Furthermore, think about the intricacy of the control of this speech phenomenon. Our brains drive the underlying Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts 347 348 Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts physiology of voice box, tongue, lips, and mouth movements below the level of our con- sciousness. The only thing we need to think about when speaking is what to say. It’s an astonishing ballet. The same is true for exographics. We make visual marks on a medium. The individual marks are generally meaningless but, in combination, they allow us to express and share an idea. Furthermore, when we make these marks, we don’t have to think about the muscle movement required to make them, only the idea that we wish to express. In sum, our symbolic abilities enable our vast idea-sharing network over space and time. If I want to examine the ideas of Cervantes in Don Quixote, I simply go to my library and pull out the book. 17.2 The Book’s Main Contributions I summarized the main contributions in Chapter 1. I’ll do so again here in more detail. What we’re really good at is ideation. No other species can touch us when it comes to culture. As I’ve argued, we could classify all of our ideas as one of two types. For certain ideas, like the plough, surfboards, and the backbeat, we didn’t need exographics to ideate them. For these ideas, we simply used tools to work with materials in our visual field, and eventually we arrived at them. The same is not true for the theory of evolution by natural selection, smartphones, and Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The essential question is why. Why do we need exographics to discover some ideas and not others? Contribution 1. Writing Gives Us a Way to Reify Abstract Concepts and Ideas There is no such thing as the number twenty-three in the real world. It’s not like ducks and baseball bats, concrete objects that we can touch. However our imaginations have brought it into existence through our symbolic ability. We can say “twenty-three” and we can write it on a page (usually “23” but sometimes “twenty-three” or “XXIII”). This reification via exographics brings “23” into our visual field where we’re able to manipulate it and other numbers much as we handled stone to make tools 2.5 million years ago. We’ve had a long history of manipulating objects in our visual fields with our hands. Manipulating symbolic concepts on a written page is not much different. The number “23” on a page is just as concrete as ducks and baseball bats. Hence exographics enables this reification of abstract concepts where we are then able to manipulate them to arrive at ideas like 876 × 96 = 84,096 and Special Relativity. Of considerable importance in this reification is the quality of persistence. Whereas speech is fleeting, disappearing almost as soon as it’s uttered, exographics is usually per- sistent in our visual fields. We can look at a persistent exographic argument for as long as we need to in order to understand it. In this way, exographics serves to expand our working memories almost without limit. Finally, with reification and persistence, we can discover ideas that, otherwise, would not be accessible. Hence exographics are important because they give us access to many more useful ideas. Contribution 2. Without Writing We Can’t Measure I’ve argued the tremendous reach of measurement in our economic lives. We earn incomes measured in money terms, and we spend these incomes on various quantities of goods, each with a price. Business firms measure their costs, revenues, and profits. The stock market has thousands of equities trading in prices that fluctuate minute to minute. We measure how well the economy does as a whole with GDP. There are a number of measures of money supply and we can borrow various amounts from lenders at various interest rates. These measures constitute just a small part of the economic measurement we do. What about measurement within science and engineering? Here the list is just about infi- nite. What about other aspects of our life? We measure blood pressure and batting averages. We identify the time of day with a digital measurement. The calendar date is also a measure- ment. Our ages are measured in years. The government assigns us numbers for identification purposes. My golf clubs are numbered. When I cook, I make a lot of measurements, espe- cially when I want to restrict my caloric intake. We measure a President’s approval rating. If you read the NY Times, it’s very difficult to find an article which does not include some reference to a statistic or measurement. In sum, if we wrote down all of what we measured, it would be a long list. Let me argue the necessity of exographics for measurement. To be able to measure as we do, we need a good number system. We’ve been developing these systems for a long time. In fact, we started to develop them about the same time we invented exographics. As I’ve argued, exographics were invented to solve the administrative problems associated with the agricultural exchange economies that developed in the ancient city-states of Mesopotamia. In these settlements, the administrators had to keep track of who owed what to the temple and the palace. Keeping track of it with just human memory became too much. Hence exograph- ics were invented to relieve the cognitive problems associated with transactionally intensive economies. Furthermore, our first attempts at exographics were at best short inscriptions describing transactions. They were definitely not used to record our speech in sentences and paragraphs. This early exographics gave us the ability to define sophisticated number systems, including operations with those numbers (addition, subtraction, etc.) If you look at indigenous societies without writing systems, their number systems are simple. Most of them use just four quantities: none, 1, 2, and many. Some are more sophisticated but not much.1 The logic 1 For example, I documented the number system of the Oksapmin people of Papua New Guinea. Their number system com- prises the first 29 integers and each number is associated with a body part. Hence, in order to have the more complicated system and deal with it cognitively, the Oksapmin have grounded their system in a visual representation. Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts 349 350 Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts is simple: measurement requires a number system, and to discover and use a sophisticated number system requires exographics. The implication is that any sort of sophisticated mea- surement requires the technology of exographics. I reviewed the early history of the invention of numbers. As we saw, the ancient peo- ples of Mesopotamia used small tokens as counters. While we’re unsure how these systems worked, they were clearly material in nature. Much as a child learns about numbers with manipulatives, our ancestors used three-dimensional counters to do their accounting mea- surements. In effect, this is embodied thinking using material artifacts. Over time, these ancient accountants graduated from three-dimensional tokens to two-dimensional symbolic notations on clay tablets. Contribution 3. Conceptualizing the Ideasphere and Reconsid- ering “The Great Divide” The fundamental concept of my development is the idea. Before we actually produce some- thing like a smartphone, there has to be a lot of thinking. This thinking leads to ideas which in turn lead to cultural artifacts like smartphones. The anthropologist Wade Davis defined the Ethnosphere to be “the sum total of all thoughts and intuitions, myths and beliefs, ideas and inspirations brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.”2 My definition of the Ideasphere is a slight variation. Since all cultural objects begin as ideas, I define the Ideasphere to be the sum total of all ideas brought into being by human imagination. This definition and the recognition that certain ideas require writing to discover lead naturally to a partition of the Ideasphere into the A Class (ideas that require writing to dis- cover) and the C Class (ideas which don’t require writing to discover). I’ve outlined the structure of the A Class (what’s in it, what’s not, and the interrelation- ships among these ideas). I then argued that the A Class includes the material artifacts of modern life in a techno-literate society, things like computer technology, the Internet, MRI machines, aircraft, and knowledge of the human genome. Then I described how the A Class has grown exponentially over the last 500 years and that there is no reason to believe that this exponential growth will not continue. After defining the A and C Classes, I then discussed the root causes of “The Great Divide,” Jack Goody’s name for the vast differences between modern techno-literate societ- ies and oral indigenous societies. Initially, scholars like Goody, Walter Ong, and Eric Have- lock explained the difference with writing. This spawned a significant reaction with most scholars now taking the position that Goody et al. were wrong and that the explanation involved education among other factors. My argument is that Goody, Ong, et al. were right but not for the reasons they suggest. As I have explained, the exographic technology gives its users the ability to discover A Class 2 Wade Davis, The Wayfinders: Why Ancient Wisdom Matters in the Modern World (Toronto: Anansi Press, 2009), 2. ideas and it is these ideas that are at the heart of the difference between the two societies. Moreover, it doesn’t take any special cognitive power to operate the technology. In fact, the evidence suggests that individuals born into an oral society are capable of learning and using the exographics technology. This was certainly the case with the children of Luria’s peas- ants and there are many other examples. In Canada, we have the example of the indigenous author and playwright Tomson Highway and many others born into indigenous societies who later excelled at A Class ideation. Highway, in his words, “was born in a snowbank” to Cree parents and raised according to Cree traditions. He was sent to a residential school and there learned his literacy and musical skills. Highway is one of Canada’s most accomplished indig- enous playwrights and authors. His work has won many awards, and he has been awarded nine honorary university degrees and the Order of Canada. Most importantly for my work, Highway is an example of my claim that indigenous peoples are perfectly capable of learning and using the exographics technology. What comes to mind is Bruno Latour’s idea: “No ‘new man’ suddenly emerged sometime in the sixteenth century, and there are no mutants with larger brains working inside modern laboratories who can think differently from the rest of us.” 3 He is suggesting that being bathed in literacy and its associated thinking does not lead to any permanent cognitive advantage. Let’s now put our education systems in perspective. Contribution 4. Explaining the Origin of Our Massively Literate Education System Cultural transmission to the next generation is critical in all societies. To make the point, I appealed to the work of a number of scholars but most especially to the work of Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich. I began by looking at cultural transmission in oral indigenous societies. These societies have been exceedingly clever in C Class ideation enabling them to thrive in their surroundings. I focussed on the Inuit who have survived for thousands of years in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. For these societies, the younger generation needs to understand all aspects of hunting, transportation, shelter, and energy to name just a few things on a long list. This transmission is usually accomplished with a “learn-by-doing” system. In the same way, there must be a cultural transfer to the younger generation in our techno- literate societies. One of our primary ways of doing this is to send our children to school for a considerable period of time to learn the exographics technology and the associated cultural knowledge and ways of thinking that come with it. There are other aspects of this education but a literate education is critical for younger people to be able to function in our societies as adults. As time has passed, our education system has become more complex because of our continued expansion of the A Class and the expanding complexity of our societies. In 3 Bruno Latour, “Visualisation and Cognition: Drawing Things Together,” in Knowledge and Society - Studies in the Soci- ology of Culture Past and Present, eds. Elizabeth Long and Henrika Kuklick, (Jai Press: Stamford, 1986), 1. Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts 351 352 Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts addition, our education system is very much a “learn-by-doing” approach. To learn how to print the letter “a”, young primary school students practise doing it. A university student learns the calculus by studying examples. Much of our education system is “learn-by-doing.” Here’s the important point. Would we need these massively literate education systems if we had not invented the exographics technology? Surely not! Our modern massively literate education systems have only arisen because we invented exographics. Contribution 5. Assessing the Evidence That Enhancements to Exographic Technologies Lead to Step Increases in A Class Ideation In the last three chapters of the book, I looked at the long history of the technology of writing and its association with A Class expansion. All things equal, we would expect that improvements in the exographics technology would lead to A Class expansion. Look at what happened in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks perfected a phonetic exographics system that was easier to learn than the pictographic/logographic systems that arose in other cul- tures. This, combined with the Greek belief in a democratic education system (at least for males), resulted in more A Class capability which, in turn, led to an explosion in A Class ideas including ideas in philosophy, mathematics, science, astronomy, literature, drama, and poetry. Overall, the evidence I presented suggests that improvements in exographics technol- ogy played a significant role in the expansion of the A Class. Contribution 6. Assessing the Future of Ideation Technologies and the Ideasphere The conventional wisdom is that we are now well down the road of reproducing the ideation abilities of our networked minds with machines. By some accounts, this “singularity” is not far off. I have doubts. To make the point, I looked at some cases of our substantial A Class ideation. One is the Wright Brothers and their discovery of the principles of powered flight. Theirs was a story of multi-year experimentation with flyer design and flight-control surfaces that eventually gave them the principles of the control of powered flight. It is very difficult to imagine how machines would be able to replicate their work, much less work that would result in some new technology that adds as much as the Wrights discovered. Their work constituted genius-level embodied thinking. In principle, it ought to be doable because, as Rodney Brooks has suggested: “We already have an existence proof . . . human beings.”4 But we’re going to need a much better understanding of how embodied thinking works. A second consideration is whether there are other technologies besides exographics that will enable us to make further inroads in the Ideasphere. Up to the invention of exographics, our ideation was restricted to the C Class. With exographics, we were able to discover and 4 Rodney Brooks, “Intelligence Without Representation,” Artificial Intelligence 47 (1991): 139. expand the A Class. My question is whether there are other technologies, ones we’ve yet to invent, that will enable us to open up another class of ideas, a class I called the X Class. Since our ability to ideate is so tied to our vision, it could be that the next important technologies are ones that enhance our vision. Alternatively, it could be technologies which enhance our collaboration in some way, a path we are already pursuing with the growth of the Internet and our search capability using it. At the moment, these are just conjectures. Contribution 7. The Diaconatic as an Embodied Model of Thinking The diaconatic is a model of embodied thinking that posits thought as a sequence of itera- tions with each iteration following two distinct steps. At the Idea Step, the thinker is looking for a way forward. He or she examines the state of the development of the idea and seeks an action that would move the idea closer to the objective the thinker has in mind. For example, Wilbur Wright is on record as saying that his observations of bird gliding led him to the idea of changing the shape of their Flyer’s wings to change the path of flight. The Action Step is then executing the idea the Idea Step produces. Once the Action Step is finished, the thinker begins another Idea Step / Action Step iteration. These iterations continue until the thinker gets to some suitable end-state. As I see it, this model of thinking is applicable to all human creativity from the arts to the humanities, to social science, and to science and engineering. It applies to either C Class or A Class ideation. Not all diaconatic iterations are successful so there is never a smooth path from initial idea to finished idea and, in this way, it’s akin to the scientific method applied to thinking. At its essence, the diaconatic is an experimental approach to get to an idea. One key aspect of the diaconatic is that it requires a thinker to use his or her hands at the Action Step. It is impossible to do any serious ideation without using your hands. Contribution 8. The Diagraphic as the Visual Extension of the Dialectic The focus of the book has been the effect of exographics on thought. Speech is also crucial. We definitely use it for teaching. It’s also important for the Idea Step of the diaconatic when we engage in the dialectic. When two or more thinkers get together to discuss a problem, what one thinker says may cause a listener to think of something he or she might not have otherwise. Effectively, the dialectic is a way for a group to stimulate associations they could not reach to individually. By definition, the ideas of the A Class are written down and this corpus comprises journal articles, periodical articles, books, encyclopedias, and other kinds of printed fora. Furthermore, most of these are now easily accessed with search engines on the Internet. I can easily find what other thinkers have thought on any idea that interests me. In effect this constitutes the dialectic over time and space. I can easily find out what Wittgenstein thought about the limits of lan- guage by looking at his Tractatus. Newton’s original notebooks are available on the Cambridge university website. Looking at what others have thought and written accomplishes the same Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts 353 354 Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts thing as the dialectic. It stirs my mind and causes me to think things I otherwise would not. Since this stirring involves exographics (and not language as the dialectic does), I refer to this process as the diagraphic and its literal translation is “through text.” 17.3 The Case for Exographics as a Discipline We live in societies steeped in literacy and writing. All of us spend a lot of time learning the three Rs. You begin, quite early, to learn how to recognize the letters of the alphabet by name, how to print them, and how to sound them. Next you learn to recognize words. Finally you start to read and then progress to more difficult texts over time. You also begin to learn how to write, the skill of translating your thoughts to the page. All of this is to prepare you to participate in a highly literate society. Certainly, writing is fundamental to college and university study. Students use it to take class notes, to do rough work as they put together assignments and essays, to record lab results, to write exams, and more. Professors use it extensively in teaching and especially in their research. Writing is endemic to every subject you could possibly study at university. The other side of writing is reading. When reading, we’re generally embracing someone else’s ideas. I believe that high school, college, and university students would benefit from a course in exographics, the fundamental technology they use to think. The subject matter of the course would be largely the contents of this book. It would explain embodied thinking, the Ideasphere and its partition into the A and C classes, the fundamentals of individual thought, the founda- tions of our collaborative networked thought, the history of the writing technology and how it’s impacted ideation, the role of writing/literacy in education, and the role of writing/literacy in explaining the marked differences between those societies with writing and those without. Finally, I think it’s important to give students a balanced appreciation for the effects of the technology. It’s given us a powerful tool to discover ideas we otherwise couldn’t, giving rise to our advanced techno-literate societies. But it’s spawned a number of problems, including inequality (particularly economic inequality), war and destruction on a global scale, geno- cide, and the wherewithal to destroy the planet (nuclear proliferation, climate degradation). 17.4 The Idea in a Nutshell If you want a single statement of the book’s contribution, it’s this: The ideas of the A Class come from thinkers firmly rooted in a mind-sharing cultural network who mix a large mea- sure of imagination with a pinch of exogram technology. Last Lecture, Last Point When I teach my course based on this book, I normally end with these desiderata for my students: Catching Unicorns I’d like you to understand that the only way to overcome a memory as poor as mine is with a string of exographics carefully crafted. Appreciate this great gift has its origins around the campfires of the Fertile Crescent about 5,000 years ago and has been passed to us through the ancient Greeks, the Romans, and the great educational institutions of the West. I’d like you to know that the intellectual vibration that comes with attentive, disciplined reading—with pen in hand as required—is the surest path to what is useful, beautiful, and true. I’d like you to feel the joy that comes with the acts of thinking and discovering, and know that, with these friends, the unexamined life is well worth living. I’d like you to believe that your mind is potentially as powerful as Aristotle’s and all the rest. You are capable of ideas that nobody has yet thought, great ideas that can make a difference. I’d like you to appreciate that living a peaceful, fulfilled life has a lot to do with following Goethe’s great advice: “One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words.” Good hunting!

It all begins with our imaginations, this facility we have to “see” alternate futures and then make some of those futures happen. The first evidence of it goes back to our ancient ancestors who chipped stone to make tools. They imagined a tool which enabled them to do things more easily. Butchering a carcass is easier if you have a stone with a sharp edge to cut meat. Using a large stone to break a bone gave our ancestors access to the marrow so rich in protein and other nutrients. Flash forward to the present and we are now attempting to replicate the fusion reaction which powers the Sun.

Likely as a result of climate change, we rose to bipedal movement which had a number of benefits. First, it took decidedly less energy to move, and second, it freed our hands to do other things. Chief among these is tool-making and thinking. Our hands evolved from those essential for arboreal movement to being useful for grasping weapons and tools. Relative to other primates, we developed a much larger opposable thumb and this enabled us to grasp and use tools. Along with form, our hands have become incredibly dextrous (in this regard, think concert pianist, surgeon, or Sidney Crosby) The fossil evidence supports the view that our ability to alter our environments with these new tools and other cultural achievements has changed our evolutionary path.

Consequently, we have two forces acting on us: the biological force of evolution through our genes and the cultural force of our ideation through our thinking. 17.1 The Power of Collaboration A key feature of this cultural force playing gently but forcefully in the background is our mind-sharing and collaborative ability. This ability likely has its origin in the hunt and goes back millions of years. Certainly, each of us has evolved an ability to imagine and then work with our hands to bring a cultural idea to the fore but what really magni- fies this individual ability is our mind-sharing and cooperative efforts.","content_length":905,"content_tokens":186,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"It gives us such things as the ITER in its present state, the International Space Station, and the iPhone.

Con- sider for a moment Bach’s Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring. We tend to think of it as the mag- nificent work of an individual genius. And it is. However there is also a sense in which it’s a creation enabled by a significant mind-sharing cultural network. Let me argue it this way.

Their development continues from Rome to the Renaissance and Claudio Moneverdi (1567–1643 CE) who originated an orchestra with each instru- ment’s part mapped out on paper. I’ve already discussed the role of exographics and staff notation in the design and execution of complex polyphonic music. This is also done with the arrangement of the voices in the choir.

Bach himself was born into a musical family in baroque-era Germany and, from an early age, was tutored in all aspects of the music of his era.

We can project a sequence of sounds toward another person. The fundamental components of that sequence, phonemes, are individually meaningless, but in sequence they are meaningful. Furthermore, think about the intricacy of the control of this speech phenomenon. Our brains drive the underlying Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts 347 348 Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts physiology of voice box, tongue, lips, and mouth movements below the level of our con- sciousness.

I’ll do so again here in more detail. What we’re really good at is ideation. No other species can touch us when it comes to culture.

The same is not true for the theory of evolution by natural selection, smartphones, and Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The essential question is why. Why do we need exographics to discover some ideas and not others? Contribution 1. Writing Gives Us a Way to Reify Abstract Concepts and Ideas There is no such thing as the number twenty-three in the real world.

We’ve had a long history of manipulating objects in our visual fields with our hands. Manipulating symbolic concepts on a written page is not much different. The number “23” on a page is just as concrete as ducks and baseball bats. Hence exographics enables this reification of abstract concepts where we are then able to manipulate them to arrive at ideas like 876 × 96 = 84,096 and Special Relativity. Of considerable importance in this reification is the quality of persistence.","content_length":773,"content_tokens":189,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"Whereas speech is fleeting, disappearing almost as soon as it’s uttered, exographics is usually per- sistent in our visual fields.

Finally, with reification and persistence, we can discover ideas that, otherwise, would not be accessible. Hence exographics are important because they give us access to many more useful ideas. Contribution 2. Without Writing We Can’t Measure I’ve argued the tremendous reach of measurement in our economic lives. We earn incomes measured in money terms, and we spend these incomes on various quantities of goods, each with a price. Business firms measure their costs, revenues, and profits. The stock market has thousands of equities trading in prices that fluctuate minute to minute.

Our ages are measured in years. The government assigns us numbers for identification purposes. My golf clubs are numbered. When I cook, I make a lot of measurements, espe- cially when I want to restrict my caloric intake. We measure a President’s approval rating.

To be able to measure as we do, we need a good number system. We’ve been developing these systems for a long time. In fact, we started to develop them about the same time we invented exographics.

In these settlements, the administrators had to keep track of who owed what to the temple and the palace. Keeping track of it with just human memory became too much. Hence exograph- ics were invented to relieve the cognitive problems associated with transactionally intensive economies.

In fact, the evidence suggests that individuals born into an oral society are capable of learning and using the exographics technology.

In Canada, we have the example of the indigenous author and playwright Tomson Highway and many others born into indigenous societies who later excelled at A Class ideation.

Highway is one of Canada’s most accomplished indig- enous playwrights and authors. His work has won many awards, and he has been awarded nine honorary university degrees and the Order of Canada. Most importantly for my work, Highway is an example of my claim that indigenous peoples are perfectly capable of learning and using the exographics technology. What comes to mind is Bruno Latour’s idea: “No ‘new man’ suddenly emerged sometime in the sixteenth century, and there are no mutants with larger brains working inside modern laboratories who can think differently from the rest of us.” 3 He is suggesting that being bathed in literacy and its associated thinking does not lead to any permanent cognitive advantage. Let’s now put our education systems in perspective.

To make the point, I appealed to the work of a number of scholars but most especially to the work of Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich. I began by looking at cultural transmission in oral indigenous societies. These societies have been exceedingly clever in C Class ideation enabling them to thrive in their surroundings. I focussed on the Inuit who have survived for thousands of years in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. For these societies, the younger generation needs to understand all aspects of hunting, transportation, shelter, and energy to name just a few things on a long list. This transmission is usually accomplished with a “learn-by-doing” system. In the same way, there must be a cultural transfer to the younger generation in our techno- literate societies.","content_length":953,"content_tokens":190,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"One of our primary ways of doing this is to send our children to school for a considerable period of time to learn the exographics technology and the associated cultural knowledge and ways of thinking that come with it. There are other aspects of this education but a literate education is critical for younger people to be able to function in our societies as adults. As time has passed, our education system has become more complex because of our continued expansion of the A Class and the expanding complexity of our societies.

A university student learns the calculus by studying examples. Much of our education system is “learn-by-doing.” Here’s the important point. Would we need these massively literate education systems if we had not invented the exographics technology? Surely not! Our modern massively literate education systems have only arisen because we invented exographics. Contribution 5. Assessing the Evidence That Enhancements to Exographic Technologies Lead to Step Increases in A Class Ideation In the last three chapters of the book, I looked at the long history of the technology of writing and its association with A Class expansion. All things equal, we would expect that improvements in the exographics technology would lead to A Class expansion. Look at what happened in ancient Greece.","content_length":870,"content_tokens":174,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"The ancient Greeks perfected a phonetic exographics system that was easier to learn than the pictographic/logographic systems that arose in other cul- tures. This, combined with the Greek belief in a democratic education system (at least for males), resulted in more A Class capability which, in turn, led to an explosion in A Class ideas including ideas in philosophy, mathematics, science, astronomy, literature, drama, and poetry. Overall, the evidence I presented suggests that improvements in exographics technol- ogy played a significant role in the expansion of the A Class. Contribution 6. Assessing the Future of Ideation Technologies and the Ideasphere The conventional wisdom is that we are now well down the road of reproducing the ideation abilities of our networked minds with machines. By some accounts, this “singularity” is not far off. I have doubts. To make the point, I looked at some cases of our substantial A Class ideation.","content_length":947,"content_tokens":198,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"One is the Wright Brothers and their discovery of the principles of powered flight. Theirs was a story of multi-year experimentation with flyer design and flight-control surfaces that eventually gave them the principles of the control of powered flight. It is very difficult to imagine how machines would be able to replicate their work, much less work that would result in some new technology that adds as much as the Wrights discovered. Their work constituted genius-level embodied thinking. In principle, it ought to be doable because, as Rodney Brooks has suggested: “We already have an existence proof    human beings.”4 But we’re going to need a much better understanding of how embodied thinking works. A second consideration is whether there are other technologies besides exographics that will enable us to make further inroads in the Ideasphere. Up to the invention of exographics, our ideation was restricted to the C Class.","content_length":935,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"With exographics, we were able to discover and 4 Rodney Brooks, “Intelligence Without Representation,” Artificial Intelligence 47 (1991): 139. expand the A Class. My question is whether there are other technologies, ones we’ve yet to invent, that will enable us to open up another class of ideas, a class I called the X Class. Since our ability to ideate is so tied to our vision, it could be that the next important technologies are ones that enhance our vision. Alternatively, it could be technologies which enhance our collaboration in some way, a path we are already pursuing with the growth of the Internet and our search capability using it. At the moment, these are just conjectures. Contribution 7. The Diaconatic as an Embodied Model of Thinking The diaconatic is a model of embodied thinking that posits thought as a sequence of itera- tions with each iteration following two distinct steps.","content_length":901,"content_tokens":192,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"At the Idea Step, the thinker is looking for a way forward. He or she examines the state of the development of the idea and seeks an action that would move the idea closer to the objective the thinker has in mind. For example, Wilbur Wright is on record as saying that his observations of bird gliding led him to the idea of changing the shape of their Flyer’s wings to change the path of flight. The Action Step is then executing the idea the Idea Step produces. Once the Action Step is finished, the thinker begins another Idea Step / Action Step iteration. These iterations continue until the thinker gets to some suitable end-state. As I see it, this model of thinking is applicable to all human creativity from the arts to the humanities, to social science, and to science and engineering. It applies to either C Class or A Class ideation.","content_length":844,"content_tokens":176,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"Not all diaconatic iterations are successful so there is never a smooth path from initial idea to finished idea and, in this way, it’s akin to the scientific method applied to thinking. At its essence, the diaconatic is an experimental approach to get to an idea. One key aspect of the diaconatic is that it requires a thinker to use his or her hands at the Action Step. It is impossible to do any serious ideation without using your hands. Contribution 8. The Diagraphic as the Visual Extension of the Dialectic The focus of the book has been the effect of exographics on thought. Speech is also crucial. We definitely use it for teaching. It’s also important for the Idea Step of the diaconatic when we engage in the dialectic. When two or more thinkers get together to discuss a problem, what one thinker says may cause a listener to think of something he or she might not have otherwise.","content_length":891,"content_tokens":196,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"Effectively, the dialectic is a way for a group to stimulate associations they could not reach to individually. By definition, the ideas of the A Class are written down and this corpus comprises journal articles, periodical articles, books, encyclopedias, and other kinds of printed fora. Furthermore, most of these are now easily accessed with search engines on the Internet. I can easily find what other thinkers have thought on any idea that interests me. In effect this constitutes the dialectic over time and space. I can easily find out what Wittgenstein thought about the limits of lan- guage by looking at his Tractatus. Newton’s original notebooks are available on the Cambridge university website. Looking at what others have thought and written accomplishes the same Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts 353 354 Chapter 17 Closing Thoughts thing as the dialectic. It stirs my mind and causes me to think things I otherwise would not.","content_length":935,"content_tokens":188,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"Since this stirring involves exographics (and not language as the dialectic does), I refer to this process as the diagraphic and its literal translation is “through text.” 17.3 The Case for Exographics as a Discipline We live in societies steeped in literacy and writing. All of us spend a lot of time learning the three Rs. You begin, quite early, to learn how to recognize the letters of the alphabet by name, how to print them, and how to sound them. Next you learn to recognize words. Finally you start to read and then progress to more difficult texts over time. You also begin to learn how to write, the skill of translating your thoughts to the page. All of this is to prepare you to participate in a highly literate society. Certainly, writing is fundamental to college and university study.","content_length":799,"content_tokens":171,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"Students use it to take class notes, to do rough work as they put together assignments and essays, to record lab results, to write exams, and more. Professors use it extensively in teaching and especially in their research. Writing is endemic to every subject you could possibly study at university. The other side of writing is reading. When reading, we’re generally embracing someone else’s ideas. I believe that high school, college, and university students would benefit from a course in exographics, the fundamental technology they use to think. The subject matter of the course would be largely the contents of this book.","content_length":627,"content_tokens":125,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"It would explain embodied thinking, the Ideasphere and its partition into the A and C classes, the fundamentals of individual thought, the founda- tions of our collaborative networked thought, the history of the writing technology and how it’s impacted ideation, the role of writing/literacy in education, and the role of writing/literacy in explaining the marked differences between those societies with writing and those without. Finally, I think it’s important to give students a balanced appreciation for the effects of the technology. It’s given us a powerful tool to discover ideas we otherwise couldn’t, giving rise to our advanced techno-literate societies. But it’s spawned a number of problems, including inequality (particularly economic inequality), war and destruction on a global scale, geno- cide, and the wherewithal to destroy the planet (nuclear proliferation, climate degradation)","content_length":899,"content_tokens":187,"embedding":[]},{"title":"Closing Thoughts","content":"17.4 The Idea in a Nutshell If you want a single statement of the book’s contribution, it’s this: The ideas of the A Class come from thinkers firmly rooted in a mind-sharing cultural network who mix a large mea- sure of imagination with a pinch of exogram technology.
